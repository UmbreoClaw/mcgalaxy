# Survival-support session notes

**Branch:** `survival-support`
**Date:** 2026-07-15
**Scope:** Server-side *foundation* for the ClassiCube "survival-test" client.

Companion to the client-side docs in the ClassiCube fork:
`doc/survival-handshake.md` and `doc/networking-plan.md`
(branch `survival-test`). The wire contract is `src/SurvivalNet.h` in that repo.

---

## Goal

Let survival-test ClassiCube clients connect to MCGalaxy, negotiate a survival
capability, and receive a per-map survival handshake — **without** changing
anything for stock Classic / CPE-only clients, who must keep connecting and
playing exactly as before.

This landed the **foundation only**, deliberately mirroring what the client
foundation implements: capability negotiation + the handshake send path +
inbound receive/validate/log. The actual state appliers (mobs, inventory,
drops, health, day/night) and the client's simulation "mode-flip" are
**deferred** — see `roadmap.md`. Every message id is reserved up front so the
remaining work is fill-in against a fixed contract, not new protocol design.

---

## The one idea: capability vs. activation are two layers

| Layer | Scope | Set by | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Capability** (`hasSurvival`) | whole connection | CPE `SurvivalTest` ext, negotiated once at login | "Can this client speak survival?" |
| **Activation** (`SurvivalMode`) | per map | level config, sent via `SURV_HELLO` | "Is *this* map survival?" |

MCGalaxy is a **multi-level** server: a player `/goto`s between a plain Classic
build map and a survival map on the *same connection*. The CPE handshake fires
once and cannot re-fire per map, so it can only answer the capability question.
Whether a given map is survival changes on every level switch, so it rides a
per-map message. Folding both into one flag would make it impossible to turn
survival on for one level and off for the next.

Consequence: survival traffic is sent **iff** `hasSurvival && SurvivalMode != Off`.

---

## Transport

Survival messages ride the existing CPE **PluginMessages** extension
(opcode `0x35`) on a single channel:

```
SURVNET_CHANNEL = 0xB0
```

Each message is `[id:1][fields...]` inside the fixed 64-byte PluginMessage
payload (66 bytes on the wire: `[0x35][channel][payload:64]`). Multi-byte
fields are big-endian; unused tail bytes are zero and ignored. MCGalaxy already
had `Packet.PluginMessage(...)` and `OnPluginMessageReceivedEvent`, so no new
opcode or framing was needed — this is the sanctioned escape hatch for custom
payloads over a known, negotiated opcode.

`0xB0` sits high on purpose to avoid clashing with a channel a plugin might
casually pick. **Do not reuse `0xB0` for anything else.**

---

## Changes, file by file

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `MCGalaxy/Network/CPESupport.cs` | New `CpeExt.SurvivalTest` constant; advertise `SurvivalTest` v1 in `CpeExtension.All` so the server both offers it and recognises the client's `ExtEntry`. |
| `MCGalaxy/Network/IGameSession.cs` | New per-session fast-path flag `public bool hasSurvival;`. |
| `MCGalaxy/Network/ClassicProtocol.cs` | In `AddExtension`, set `hasSurvival = true` when the client negotiates `SurvivalTest`. |
| `MCGalaxy/Levels/LevelConfig.cs` | Per-map survival options (see "Config" below). `SurvivalMode` doubles as the activation gate. |
| `MCGalaxy/Network/SurvivalNet.cs` | **New.** The whole survival protocol surface: channel + message-id contract, `SURV_HELLO` / `SURV_WORLDINFO` builders, and the inbound dispatch (bounds-checked, validated, logged; appliers deferred). |
| `MCGalaxy/CorePlugin/MiscHandlers.cs` | `HandleSentMap` calls `SurvivalNet.SendHandshake(p, level)` alongside the other per-map CPE sends (textures, block permissions). |
| `MCGalaxy/CorePlugin/CorePlugin.cs` | Register/unregister `SurvivalNet.HandlePluginMessage` on `OnPluginMessageReceivedEvent`. |
| `MCGalaxy/CorePlugin/ConnectHandler.cs` | On connect, call `SurvivalNet.AnnounceClient(p)` — a **test aid** (see below). |
| `MCGalaxy/MCGalaxy_.csproj` | Add `Network\SurvivalNet.cs` to the explicit compile list (the classic msbuild project lists every file; the SDK/standalone projects glob). |

### Test aid: connect announcement

`SurvivalNet.AnnounceClient(p)` runs from `ConnectHandler.HandleConnect` (which
fires after CPE negotiation completes, so `hasSurvival` is already known). It
tells the joining player, and logs to the server console, whether the client was
detected as survival or normal:

- survival: `Connected via the survival client (handshake verified)`
- normal: `Connected via a normal client (no survival handshake)`

This is purely diagnostic — it is the only place that announces detection, so it
is trivial to gate behind a config flag or remove once wire testing is done.

### Where the handshake is sent

`SendRawMapCore` sends the level, then fires `OnSentMapEvent` →
`MiscHandlers.HandleSentMap`, which is exactly where per-map CPE state
(textures, block permissions) is already pushed. The survival handshake is sent
there, so it goes out right after the level on every join and every `/goto`.
The send is a no-op unless `hasSurvival && SurvivalMode != Off`, so Classic play
is untouched.

## Wire format (v1)

### `SURV_HELLO` (0x01) — server → client
| Off | Size | Field | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | id = 0x01 | |
| 1 | 1 | mode | `SurvivalMode` (0 off / 1 classic / 2 indev) |
| 2 | 1 | flags | bit0 enhanced, bit1 creative, bit2 pvp, bit3 deathDrops |
| 3 | 1 | protoVer | `SurvivalNet.ProtoVersion` (1) |

### `SURV_WORLDINFO` (0x02) — server → client
v2 layout (SurvivalTest **ext version 2** — sent when the client negotiated ≥ 2):
| Off | Size | Field | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | id = 0x02 | |
| 1 | 2 | groundLevel (i16 BE) | `EdgeLevel + SidesOffset` |
| 3 | 2 | waterLevel (i16 BE) | `EdgeLevel` (map default = height/2) |
| 5 | 1 | fluid id | `HorizonBlock` (raw) |
| 6 | 1 | theme | `SurvivalTheme` |
| 7 | 1 | flags | bit0 floating (`theme == Floating`) |
| 8 | 1 | sides block | `EdgeBlock` (raw; the "bedrock" sides) |
| 9 | 1 | edge block | `HorizonBlock` (raw; the horizon water) |

The i16 promotion exists because floating maps genuinely use groundLevel −128
/ waterLevel −127 (hell −16), which v1's u8 fields clamped to 0 — visible as
a spurious dirt horizon plane under floating islands (user-diagnosed). Both
sides branch on the **negotiated** ext version, so a v1 peer still exchanges
the old u8 layout (offsets 1..7, one byte per level). The remaining
`.mclevel` env set stays deferred; env colours already reach survival clients
via the stock CPE `EnvColors` path (`SendCurrentEnv`), so they are not
duplicated in `SURV_WORLDINFO`.

### `SURV_TIME` (0x04) — server → client
| Off | Size | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | id = 0x04 | |
| 1 | 2 | worldTime | big-endian u16; 0 sunrise, 6000 noon, 12000 sunset, 18000 midnight |
| 3 | 1 | skyLight | 0..15, eased across dawn/dusk |

The server owns the day/night cycle (the client must not run it locally in MP —
networking-plan §15.2/§17.4). A single clock is advanced on `Server.MainScheduler`
(20 world ticks/second → a 20-minute day) and pushed to every survival player once
per second, plus once at handshake to seed the client. The clock is shared across
survival maps in v1; a per-map clock (each Indev world keeps its own `TimeOfDay`)
is a future refinement. Lifecycle: `SurvivalNet.Start()`/`Stop()` from `CorePlugin`.

### `SURV_HEALTH` (0x03) — server → client
| Off | Size | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | id = 0x03 | |
| 1 | 1 | health | 0..`MAX_HEALTH` (20 = 10 hearts) |
| 2 | 4 | score | big-endian i32 |

The server owns health and score (stored in `Player.Extras`, so they follow the
player across a `/goto` within one session). `SURV_HEALTH` is sent at handshake and
whenever `SetHealth` changes it. Damage sources are deferred, so today health only
changes on respawn.

### `SURV_RESPAWN` (0x87) — client → server *(handled)*
The client's respawn intent, only honoured while **dead** (health 0): the server
clears the dwell, repositions to the map spawn (`PlayerActions.Respawn`), then
restores full health — the health rise is what removes the client's Game Over
screen. A respawn intent while alive is rejected (it would otherwise be a free
teleport to spawn) and answered with an authoritative `SURV_HEALTH` echo.

### Damage / death bridge — death-screen dwell
`SurvivalNet.OnPlayerDied` is registered on `OnPlayerDiedEvent`, which fires inside
`Player.HandleDeath` — the single choke point for **all** MCGalaxy deaths (fall,
drown, lava, killer blocks, weapons, `/kill`, …), so every hazard MCGalaxy already
detects (respecting the level's `FallHeight` / `DrownTime` / `KillerBlocks` config)
flows through. For a survival player it **holds health at 0**: the genuine flow is

1. death → `SURV_HEALTH(0)` — client shows the death camera + Game Over screen;
2. `HandleDeath` **skips its auto-respawn** while `SurvivalNet.HoldsDeathScreen`
   (survival-active and dead), and `OnPlayerDying` cancels repeat deaths so the
   killing hazard ticking at the death spot (lava, drowning) can't spam;
3. revive on the client's `SURV_RESPAWN` intent — or a **30 s safety timeout**
   (counted down by the `SURV_TIME` scheduler tick) so nobody is stranded;
4. revive = reposition to spawn, then `SURV_HEALTH(20)` (the rise revives the
   client). A map change while dead restores full health (`OnJoinedLevel`) since
   the client tears down its per-map death state.

Graduated Indev damage (partial HP from fall distance, drowning/fire ticks)
remains the future refinement; MCGalaxy still only detects lethal hazards.

**Map-spawn caveat (found in live testing):** MCGalaxy's default generated spawn
sits ~16 blocks above the ground; with `/map death on` and the default
`FallHeight` 9 every (re)spawn is a lethal fall → an infinite death loop (stock
MCGalaxy loops identically, just faster). Until the phase-1 generator places
spawns, survival maps need a grounded spawn or a raised `/map fall` threshold.

### Hack permissions follow the survival config
`Hacks.MakeHackControl` overrides the MOTD-derived flags on an active survival
map: fly/speed come from the level's `SurvivalCreative` (the *same* decision as
HELLO's creative bit, so they can never disagree — the survival-test client
defers entirely to `HackControl` in MP), noclip is off, and the respawn hack is
off (death/respawn is server-owned via `SURV_RESPAWN`). Referee mode keeps its
usual all-hacks escape hatch, and the server-side `Hacks.CanUse*` checks read
the same override. `/Survival` re-sends motd+hacks so live config changes apply.

### Phase 3 — mob streaming (`SurvivalMobs.cs`)

The server runs the whole mob simulation and streams it; the client renders a
puppet pool (its `st_mobs[]`) fed by these messages. The AI/physics is a C#
port of the ClassiCube fork's verified c0.30/Indev mob sim (BasicAI /
BasicAttackAI / EntityMob lineage), ticked at 20 TPS on a dedicated scheduler.
Only levels with players are simulated.

| msg | dir | layout |
|---|---|---|
| `SURV_MOB_SPAWN` 0x10 | S→C | `[id:u16][type][pos:3×i16 fixed(×32)][yaw:u8][pitch:u8][health][flags(b0 helmet, b1 armor, b2 fur)]` |
| `SURV_MOB_MOVE` 0x11 | S→C | `[id:u16][pos:3×i16][yaw][pitch]` — sent only when the quantised pose changed |
| `SURV_MOB_STATE` 0x12 | S→C | `[id:u16][health][flags(b0 hurt, b1 fuse, b2 onFire, b3 graze, b4 dead, b5 noFur)]` — sent on change; the hurt bit is a one-tick edge |
| `SURV_MOB_DESPAWN` 0x13 | S→C | `[id:u16][reason(0 despawn / 1 death)]` |
| `SURV_ATTACK` 0x80 | C→S | `[targetKind(0 mob)][targetId:u16]` — reach-validated (6 blocks incl. latency pad), applies melee + knockback + aggro; sheep shear rules per mode |

Simulated per mob: wander/chase/attack AI (per-type: creeper 3/7-block fuse →
30-tick blast, spider light-flee + pounce, zombie 5 / default 2 Indev melee,
c0.30 damage rolls + creeper headbutt self-damage), `Mob.travel` physics with
axis-clipped AABB collision against level blocks, fall damage, drowning,
lava/fire, sheep grazing (grass→dirt through the normal block path, so every
client sees it), undead sunburn, the c0.30 spawner (initial population + capped
top-up, min-of-two-uniforms Y bias, 16-block spawn-point exclusion) and the
600-tick/1-in-800 despawn roll. Players take graduated damage (`DamagePlayer`:
the same dual-threshold invulnerability window as mobs, ticked at 20 TPS);
lethal hits route through `HandleDeath`, so the death-screen dwell applies.
Kill credit awards the c0.30 death scores in Classic mode only.

Test aids: `/Survival spawn [zombie/skeleton/pig/creeper/spider/sheep]` (at
your feet, ground-snapped) and `/Survival mobs` (live count).

**Live-testing round 2 (user reports) — spawner + boundary fixes:**
- *"Mobs spawned once when I entered, then never again"*: the top-up spawner
  rolled map-wide random positions with a 256 cap (the client's puppet-pool
  limit), so on big maps the cap saturated with mobs nobody ever met. The
  top-up spawner now picks candidates in a ring **16–48 blocks around a
  random online survival player** (the Alpha+ spawners made the same change
  for the same reason); the c0.30 initial population stays map-wide. `area`
  floors at 1 so sub-64³ maps spawn at all.
- *"Mobs get pushed out of the map boundaries"*: `BlockAt` clamps
  out-of-bounds reads to the edge column (genuine `getBlockId` semantics),
  which reads as open air above ground — knockback punted mobs clean off the
  map. The map edge is now a wall for mob collision.
- Debug/test surface (`/Survival ...`): `time` (show or set the world clock —
  `day/noon/sunset/night/midnight/<ticks>` — pushed to all survival players
  instantly), `spawner` (tick/roll/attempt/spawn counters with per-reason
  rejection tallies + clock state), `mobs` (nearest live mobs with id/pos/
  distance/HP/target), `inv [player]` (server-side slot + cursor dump),
  `spawn [type]` (force-spawn at your feet). Natural spawns log at Debug
  level. The mob tick is wrapped in a logging try/catch.

**Live-testing round 3 — visitors play classic, untouched:**
- *"Classic players shouldn't die from falls"*: `/Survival` auto-enables
  MCGalaxy's per-level `SurvivalDeath`, whose fall/drown detection applied to
  every client on the level. On survival-mode maps hazard detection is now
  gated to survival-capable sessions — stock/plain-CPE visitors walk the map
  unharmed (mobs already ignore them: the watcher filter only targets
  survival players). Plain maps using `/map death on` keep the stock
  behaviour for everyone.
- Stock-client building on survival maps was verified working by a synthetic
  no-CPE protocol client (place + delete accepted on the wire); a classic
  player unable to build is most likely standard realm/level build
  permissions (`/os allow`, perbuild), not survival code.

### Genuine Indev player damage (`SurvivalHazards.cs`) — the death system, properly

**The problem (user-identified):** player hazards rode MCGalaxy's binary
`SurvivalDeath` system (lethal-or-nothing fall/drown), so health only ever
went 20 → 0 — graduated Indev damage never happened and the death system
didn't sync.

**Now:** a 20 TPS per-player hazard tick (on the `SurvivalMobs` scheduler,
next to the combat window countdown) simulates the genuine rules from the
same position stream `PlayerPhysics` consumed, all applied through
`DamagePlayer` so the invulnerability window + death-screen dwell hold:
- **fall**: peak-Y tracking, `ceil(dist − 3)` on landing (liquid cushions;
  teleports/respawns detected by the >8-block single-tick jump and never
  counted) — verified live: a 12-block fall dealt exactly 9 (20 → 11 HP),
  a 23-block fall killed into the dwell
- **drowning**: Indev's air counter with the −20 underflow timer (2 HP,
  first hit 320 ticks under, then every 20); c0.30's empty-air cadence
- **lava**: 10/tick through the window; **fire** (Indev): lava arms the
  600-tick burn, 1 HP per 20 ticks, water fizzes it out (fire-block contact
  waits on phase 1's custom blocks; no on-fire overlay flag exists for
  players yet — reserved-bit/`SURV_PLAYER_STATE` handoff item)
- **void**: 4/tick below y = −16 (floating maps)

The classic binary system is now fully off on survival-mode maps (visitors
untouched — re-verified with the synthetic stock client); plain maps using
`/map death on` keep stock behaviour. `OnPlayerDied` remains the bridge for
killer blocks and `/kill` only. Damage ticks log at Debug level.

**Also open from live testing:** the "classic players can't build" report —
wire-level evidence says stock building works (synthetic client transcript);
prime suspect is `/os` realm build permissions (`/os allow`). Awaiting the
exact client-side message before treating it as a survival bug.

### Visitor policy — survival worlds are survival-client-only (§16)

The networking-plan §16 invariant is now enforced: *a client that has not
negotiated `SurvivalTest` must never place or break blocks in a survival map*
(it bypasses tools, consumption, drops and physics — its edits would corrupt
the authoritative world). New per-level `SurvivalVisitors` policy
(`/Survival visitors ...`), consulted only while `SurvivalMode` is on:

- **visitor** (default) — non-survival clients may join and look; their block
  changes are cancelled + reverted, with a rate-limited explanation.
- **allow** — they build normally (owner's choice to accept desync).
- **deny** — they may not even join the map (`OnJoiningLevelEvent`).

Creative-flag maps stay free-build for everyone (no sim to corrupt), referees
keep their staff escape hatch, and draw commands are unaffected (the gate
covers manual changes). Verified with the synthetic stock client: place +
delete cancelled with the policy message; the survival client's mine→pickup
loop unaffected.

### Fallbacks for non-survival clients (§21 env + §15.1 mob mirror) + spawner pace

`SurvivalFallbacks.cs` — strictly per-session views for clients that did NOT
negotiate SurvivalTest, on survival maps (survival clients keep the genuine
sub-protocol streams):
- **Day/night via EnvColors (§21):** the survival clock scales the level's
  sky/cloud/fog/shadow/sunlight colours (quadratic ease, floored at 0.15 so
  night stays readable), sent only when the eased sky-light level changes.
  Wire-verified: noon = the level's own colours, midnight = the darkened set;
  colours restore on `/Survival off` and any normal map join.
- **Mob mirror (§15.1 fallback):** the level's mobs appear to spectators as
  plain Classic entities with CPE ChangeModel set to the mob's model (stock
  ClassiCube ships all six c0.30 models; sheared sheep use `sheep_nofur`;
  pre-CPE clients see humanoids). Entity ids allocate 254 downward (far above
  MCGalaxy's low player/bot range), up to 48 mobs per viewer, positions at
  **10 Hz** - the same cadence MCGalaxy relays player positions at, so stock
  clients' own entity interpolation smooths mobs exactly like other players
  (raised from the original 5 Hz after user feedback). No bespoke animations
  (hurt flash, swell) - visible + moving is the goal. Wire-verified: 48
  models + a ~10 Hz-per-mob teleport stream.
- **The sim stays alive for classic-only maps:** the mob tick runs whenever
  ANY player is on the level - survival clients remain the only AI targets,
  hazard tickees and puppet-stream receivers, but wandering/grazing/physics,
  the despawn "is anyone near" check, and the spawner's player-ring centres
  all count classic spectators too. Previously the sim required a survival
  client, so mobs froze mid-step the moment the last one left even with
  spectators watching (user report). Mobs still freeze on maps with nobody
  on them at all (the server-cost deviation). Verified live: with only a
  stock client on the map, the spawner kept placing and 48 mirrored mobs
  streamed at 10 Hz.

**Spawner pace fix ("awfully slow"):** the old attempt rolled a fully random
Y (~97% landed underground/in air) and pre-rolled the type (the light rule
then rejected most of the rest). Now each attempt scans its column for every
standable spot (surface and caves), picks one uniformly, and the spot's
darkness picks the type pool (dark→monsters, lit→animals - the same Indev
outcome with none of the waste). Attempts per roll dropped 10 → 2 since they
nearly always land. Measured: 29 spawns in the first ~6 s of a fresh map vs
3 per 10 s before, zero rejections. The population cap (area×20, ≤256)
provides the equilibrium.

**V1 deviations (deliberate, revisit later):**
- Indev's A* creature pathfinding is not ported — both modes use the c0.30
  direct-steer chase (mobs bump into obstacles rather than pathing around).
- Skeletons melee like zombies: arrows need their own wire messages (phase 5).
- No server-side light engine: "brightness" (darkness spawn rule, spider
  light-flee, monster fast-aging, sunburn) = sky-exposure × day/night level.
- Explosions damage players (approximate linear falloff) but never blocks —
  most MCGalaxy maps are protected builds; block damage needs opt-in config.
- No drops (phase 5): mob deaths and shears yield nothing yet.
- Mobs freeze on maps with no players at all (any player - survival or
  classic - keeps the sim running) and do not persist across restarts.
- Spawn clusters trimmed to 1–3 (genuine rolls up to 9) to tame populations.

### Phase 4 (first slice) — the server-owned inventory (`SurvivalInventory.cs`)

The server owns every inventory slot and the cursor; the client renders the
streamed view and sends click intents (echo-only, per the client plan's §27:
TCP ordering makes the server a simple deterministic sequencer — no Beta-style
transaction dance). Slot layout mirrors the client's `SurvivalTest.h` exactly:
0..35 main (0..8 hotbar), 36..44 craft, 45..98 container (reserved), 99..102
armor. State lives in `Player.Extras`, so it follows a `/goto` within a session.

| msg | dir | layout |
|---|---|---|
| `SURV_INV_FULL` 0x20 | S→C | `[baseSlot][runLen]` then runLen × `{id:u16, count:u8, dmg:i16}` (≤12/frame; main+craft then armor at handshake) |
| `SURV_INV_SLOT` 0x21 | S→C | `[slot][id:u16][count][dmg:i16]` — the echo for every mutation |
| `SURV_CURSOR` 0x25 | S→C | `[id:u16][count][dmg:i16]` — the server-owned held stack |
| `SURV_HELD_SLOT` 0x85 | C→S | `[hotbarIndex]` — tracked for place-consume preference |
| `SURV_SLOT_CLICK` 0x82 | C→S | `[slotIdx:u16][button]` — the GuiContainer click model (pickup all/half, merge to max stack, right-place-one, swap) runs on server state; container range rejected until streamed; armor accepts nothing yet |
| `SURV_RESULT_CLICK` 0x83 | C→S | validated no-op (no server-side recipes yet) |
| `SURV_CONT_CLOSE` 0x84 | C→S | refunds cursor + craft grid into the inventory (hotbar-first `storePartialItemStack` order), full resync; also closes the open container view |
| `SURV_USE_ITEM` 0x81 | C→S | `[heldSlot][x:i16][y:i16][z:i16][face]` — v1 opens container GUIs (reach-validated; chest lid-block rule; large-chest pairing); eating/tools land with items |
| `SURV_CONT_OPEN` 0x22 | S→C | `[kind][slotCount]` — 0 force-close, 1 chest(27), 2 furnace(3), 3 large chest(54), 4 workbench (3×3 over the streamed craft slots) |
| `SURV_CONT_SLOT` 0x23 | S→C | `[slot(0..53 container-relative)][id:u16][count][dmg:i16]` — client zeroes on OPEN, only occupied slots streamed, click echoes go to every viewer of the entity |
| `SURV_FURN_PROG` 0x24 | S→C | `[burn(0..12)][cook(0..24)]` pre-scaled; 0 until item smelting exists |

**Containers** (rest of the phase-4 GUI, landed): session-scoped tile
entities keyed by level+position (chest 27 / furnace 3 slots), lazily
created on first open; genuine large-chest pairing (the -X/-Z neighbour is
the upper 27 slots) and the BlockChest lid-block rule; the GuiContainer
click model resolves slots 45..98 through the player's open view. Mining a
container discards its tile entity and force-closes any viewer's screen
(CONT_OPEN kind 0). Not opened on creative maps (client-local palette
there). V1 deviations: contents vanish on destruction (scatter needs
phase-5 drops), no restart persistence, no smelting/recipes until items.

**The block bridge** (`OnBlockChangingEvent`): survival players' manual edits
feed the inventory. Mining adds the broken classic block (raw ≤ 49; liquids
yield nothing) straight to the inventory — the drop-entity hop is phase 5;
placing consumes one (held slot preferred) or is cancelled + `RevertBlock` +
resync when the player doesn't have the block. Dead players' edits are
cancelled. Creative-flag maps build free (no pickup/consume). *(Phase 1
extended the bridge past raw 49 to the Indev block set on Indev maps — see
the `SurvivalBlocks.cs` section below.)*

**V1 deviations:** no crafting recipes, no containers/furnace streaming
(0x22–0x24), no `USE_ITEM`, flat max stacks (99 c0.30 / 64 Indev — per-id
tables land with item definitions), armor slots accept nothing, death keeps
the inventory until phase-5 drops honour `SurvivalDeathDrops`, no persistence
across restarts (session-scoped like health).

### Phase 1 (step 1) — the Indev block set (`SurvivalBlocks.cs`)

Indev-mode survival maps now carry the full Indev block set as **level-scoped
BlockDefinitions** — a 1:1 port of the client fork's `IndevBlocks_Define` table
(`src/IndevTest.c`): torch 50, fire 51, water/lava source 52/53, chest 54,
gears 55, diamond ore/block 56/57, workbench 58, furnace 61 / lit 62, chest
facing views 71–74, furnace views 75–78 idle / 79–82 lit, farmland 83 / wet 84
(15/16 tall), crop stages 85–92, wall torches 94–97. Names, per-face tiles
(fronts land on the −Z/+Z/−X/+X face matching Indev metadata 2–5), collide,
sounds, lamp brightness (torch 14, fire 15, lit furnace 14) and classic
fallback ids all match the client. **No new wire messages and no ext bump** —
this rides stock CPE `DefineBlock`/`DefineBlockExt v2`/`UndefineBlock`.

The id/metadata model (networking-plan §18): the level array stores the
client's flattened **view ids** (each visible metadata state = its own id);
`SurvivalBlocks.ToIndev/FromIndev/DataMeta/ApplyDataMeta` are the ported
bijection between view ids and genuine `(id, Data nibble)` pairs — the
authoritative encoding for the upcoming map generator (step 2) and `.mclevel`
I/O (step 3).

Lifecycle: `SurvivalBlocks.Sync(lvl)` applies the set when
`SurvivalMode == Indev` and strips it otherwise — called from
`OnLevelLoadedEvent`, `SurvivalNet.Start` (already-loaded levels) and
`SurvivalNet.RefreshLevel` (live `/Survival` flips, verified: 37 undefines on
`off`, full re-apply on `indev`). The defs are **runtime-only** (never saved to
`blockdefs/lvl_*.json`); removal only strips reference-equal instances, so a
map owner's own `/lb` override at the same id survives. Pre-BlockDefs clients
get the fallback ids and a map reload on flips.

Who sees what: the **fork client** redefines these blocks locally on
`SURV_HELLO(mode=Indev)` (its `IndevTest_NetworkModeChanged` →
`IndevBlocks_Define` — genuine torch stick model, fire mesh, wall-torch tilt),
overriding the server defs, so no client change was needed. **Stock CPE
clients** render the server defs (sprite torches/crops, textured cubes).
**Pre-CPE clients** see fallbacks (torch→sapling, chest→crate, furnace→cobble,
lit→magma, farmland→dirt, diamond ore/block→iron ore/block, fire→CPE fire).
Tile indices 96+ target the fork's patched texture pack; a plain default pack
shows placeholder art there until §19 texture-pack serving lands.

The block bridge now accepts the set on Indev maps: mining a view id yields
its normalized pickup (`PickupFor` — facing views → canonical chest/furnace,
lit furnace → idle, wall torch → torch, farmland → dirt, crops/fire/sources →
nothing) and placing consumes `PlaceCost` (canonical id; unowned → revert).
**V1 deviations:** diamond ore drops itself (no diamond item yet), crops drop
nothing (seeds are an item), placement always produces the canonical facing
(placement-rotation + `SURV_BLOCKMETA` come later in phase 1), fire/sources
are obtainable only via `/Survival give`.

Debug aid: `/Survival give [block] <count> <player>` puts blocks straight into
a survival player's server inventory (names resolve against the level's custom
defs, so `torch`, `workbench`, `diamondore` work; console must name a player).

Verified live (fork client + synthetic BlockDefs client + console): all 37
defs stream on join with correct fields; give → INV echo (genuine item icons +
held torch model); in-reach place consumed a torch (x4→x3) and breaking it
picked it back up (x3→x4); placing an unowned lit furnace reverted without
consuming; a reach-rejected far place consumed nothing; classic dirt mining
still yields its pickup.

### Phase 1 (step 2) — the Indev world generator (`Generator/IndevGenerator.cs`)

A C# port of the client fork's `src/IndevGen.c` - itself a
statement-for-statement, oracle-verified port of in-20100223's
`LevelGenerator.java`. The load-bearing details the client's parity work
identified are preserved: java.util.Random's exact LCG with its **three
streams** (the generator stream; `World.random` recreated at the end of
Assembling with one burned `nextInt()`; findSpawn's own fresh Random),
MathHelper's 65536-entry float sine table built from double `Math.Sin`,
double-vs-float expression precision, and the `WR_*` World replica (clamped
out-of-range reads, interior-only `setBlock`, falling sand, still-liquid
wake-ups, flower pops that burn 4 `World.random` draws, the Assembling y-skip
quirk). Same seed/theme/type/size should reproduce the client generator's
output block-for-block (not re-verified against the Java oracle server-side -
the C port it mirrors is the verified one).

Usage: `/NewLvl <name> <w> <h> <l> indev [theme] [type] [seed]` - themes
`normal/hell/paradise/woods`, types `inland/island/floating/flat`. Width and
length must be powers of two, height ≥ 64 (the genuine size grid). Pipeline:
raise/erode heightmap (distorted noise) → soil → surface grow → cave worms →
coal/iron/gold/diamond ore worms → lava pockets → theme springs → edge-water
flood → assemble floor/borders → light+heightmap snapshot → find spawn →
generate the 7×5×7 spawn house (obsidian slab, doorway, **wall torches 94/95
mounted like genuine BlockTorch.onBlockAdded**, stored as extended custom
blocks) → grass → trees (woods ×51) → flowers/mushrooms (paradise ×10).

Generated maps come out survival-ready: `SurvivalMode=Indev`,
`SurvivalDeath=true`, the Indev block set applied, spawn inside the house
(yaw 180), and the theme environment in the level config - sky/fog/cloud
colours from the genuine constants, `EdgeLevel`=waterLevel,
`SidesOffset`=groundLevel−waterLevel, `CloudsHeight` (−16 on floating),
`HorizonBlock` water/lava + `EdgeBlock` grass/dirt as the OOB horizon-plane
approximation - which is exactly what `SURV_WORLDINFO` reads, so the client
now gets genuine per-map ground/water/fluid values.

Verified live: six worlds (normal inland / island / floating / hell /
paradise island / woods) generated in ~0.2-0.3 s each at 128×64×128;
block-histogram signatures match each theme (island ~6% ocean + beaches,
hell zero water + lava edge flood + the grass-on-beaches quirk, paradise ×10
flowers + high beaches, woods ×10 logs, floating 96% air multi-layer islands,
diamond ore present, exactly two extended-block wall torches at spawn±2);
fork-client joins show genuine-looking terrain with the mob sim populating
it, the spawn inside the house, and hell's dark red ambience.

Deviations (documented): per-theme sky brightness (hell 7, woods 12,
paradise 16 = always-day) only shapes the generation-time light snapshot and
env colours - the live server light model still uses the shared day/night
clock; `SurvivalTheme.Floating` folds the floating TYPE into the theme enum,
so a floating hell map's config reads Floating (world content is still hell);
findSpawn's 1M-attempt sky fallback drops to the sampled surface column
instead (same graceful deviation as the client port).

**Follow-up fix (same session): `SURV_WORLDINFO` v2.** Floating worlds
exposed that the v1 u8 ground/water fields clamp the genuine negative levels
to 0 (a dirt horizon plane appeared under the islands). The SurvivalTest CPE
ext is now **version 2** on both sides and `SURV_WORLDINFO` carries the
levels as i16 BE (see the wire table above); the env config the generator
writes (EdgeLevel −127 etc.) was verified correct on disk - the wire was the
only truncation. Verified live: the floating map now shows open sky + the
genuine below-island clouds (CloudsHeight −16) instead of the dirt plane.
Also fixed while there (client): `Server.SupportsSurvival` was never reset in
`Server_ResetState` on reconnect (despite a comment claiming it was) - both
it and the new `SurvivalExtVersion` now reset.

### `.mclevel` import/export (phase-1 step 3) + the furnace output guard

**Furnace output is take-only** (user-reported): `HandleSlotClick` refuses any
click on furnace container slot 2 while the cursor holds a stack (placing AND
merging), like genuine `SlotFurnace`; the client's singleplayer click path
carries the same rule. Taking from the output is the unchanged cursor-empty
pickup path. Verified live: with the furnace open, a click on the output with
coal held left the slot empty; the next click dropped the coal into the fuel
slot normally.

**`.mclevel` I/O** (`McLevelImporter` extended + new `McLevelExporter`,
`Levels/IO/`): the server now round-trips Indev's native format through the
same `SurvivalBlocks` bijection the generator uses.

- *Import* (`/Import`, files in `extra/import/`): after the stock
  Blocks/Spawn/env read, genuine ids ≥ 50 expand through
  `FromIndev` + the `Data` array's metadata **high nibble** (`ApplyDataMeta`)
  into the view-id space - chest/furnace facings 71-82, farmland 83/84, crop
  stages 85-92, wall torches 94-97 - and ids > 65 become extended custom
  blocks (`ConvertCustom`). Imported maps come out survival-ready
  (`SurvivalMode=Indev`, `SurvivalDeath=true`); the theme is recognised from
  the genuine sky colours (below-zero water level ⇒ Floating), and the OOB
  horizon planes normalise exactly like the generator (still fluid,
  grass/dirt sides).
- *Export* (`/Survival export <name> <level>` → `extra/import/<name>.mclevel`,
  immediately `/Import`-able): hand-rolled gzip NBT writer emitting the
  client's `MCLevel_Save` schema - `About`, the `Environment` set (colours,
  signed `Surrounding*Height`, always-grass `SurroundingGroundType`, genuine
  fluid id, `TimeOfDay` from the global clock), `Map` with
  `Blocks`=`ToIndev(view)` and `Data`=`DataMeta(view)<<4 | 0x0F` (full light),
  a minimal `LocalPlayer` entity at the spawn (genuine Indev expects one),
  and chest/furnace `TileEntities` with live contents via
  `SurvivalInventory.SnapshotContainers` - one entry per container *block*
  (genuine Indev NPE-crashes opening a chest with no tile entity), empty for
  never-opened containers.

Verified live: export gt1 → `/Import` → per-cell view-id comparison of the
two `.lvl` files = **0 of 1,048,576 cells differ**, env/survival properties
identical, the imported map re-applies the block set on load, and the client
spawns inside the round-tripped house (chest/furnace/workbench/wall-torch
views intact); a furnace loaded with coal exports its tile entity with the
stack in fuel slot 1. Deliberate v1 gaps: imported `TileEntities` contents
are NOT restored (the container registry is session-scoped - persistence is
a known deviation), player inventory/mob entities are not exported, and
`TimeOfDay` imports as nothing (global clock).

### Placement shaping + block-def polish (user request)

The server now mirrors the client's SP placement handling
(`IndevTest_BlockChanged` + `IndevTest_CanPlaceBlockAt`) in the block
bridge, so multiplayer placements come out shaped authoritatively
(`ValidateIndevPlace` in `SurvivalInventory.cs`; the canonical place is
cancelled and the directional view broadcast via `lvl.UpdateBlock`, which
also confirms - or corrects - the fork client's local guess):

- **Furnaces and chests face the placer** (BlockFurnace.setDefaultDirection):
  the placer's yaw quadrant picks Indev facing metadata 3/4/2/5 - the exact
  client formula, with yaw as the wire byte (`(RotY*4+128)>>8 & 3`).
- **Torches wall-mount** off their support (BlockTorch.onBlockAdded's
  -X/+X/-Z/+Z/floor order); an unsupported torch placement is refused
  before anything is consumed. "Normal cube" is approximated as solid
  collide + light-blocking (glass/leaves/plants/slabs excluded), matching
  genuine's isBlockNormalCube closely. Deviation: the clicked-face override
  (onBlockPlaced) needs face info the classic place packet doesn't carry -
  when several supports exist the auto pick wins and the echo corrects the
  client (quality-pass candidate: ride the face byte on a placement intent).
- **Chest triples/L-shapes are refused** (BlockChest.canPlaceBlockAt: at
  most one neighbouring chest, never one already half of a double) - stock
  clients could previously build shapes the large-chest pairing can't open.
- The shaping also runs on **creative maps** and for **permitted stock
  builders** (visitors=allow / referees), so the world stays consistent
  regardless of who builds.

Block-set finishing (`SurvivalBlocks.cs`):

- **The CPE leftovers are gone from Indev maps**: turquoise wool(59),
  ice(60), pillar(63), crate(64), stone brick(65) hold no genuine Indev
  block (the client's nonGenuine list). They are now defined with their CPE
  default appearance but hidden from the block menu (`InventoryOrder 0`,
  owner /lb defs respected), and the bridge refuses placing any 50-65 id
  that isn't part of the set - previously they placed FREE (cost 0
  passthrough) on survival maps.
- **Torch defs are proper thin columns** for stock clients: the old
  full-size X sprite is now a cube def whose bounds crop the tile to the
  genuine 2/16-wide, 10/16-tall stick (top tile 117 shows the ember),
  standing and wall views alike. The def model can't express the genuine
  wall tilt, and offsetting the column would move the crop off the torch
  pixels - so wall views render centred (the fork draws the real tilted
  geometry locally). Farmland 15/16, crops' 4/16 pick box, sources, gears
  and the container facings were audited against the client table - already
  faithful.

Verified live (fork client + gdb-driven placements on the round-tripped
map): standing torch on open floor; floating torch refused (cell reverts,
nothing consumed); furnace -> faced view 76 and chest -> 72 matching the
placer's yaw; second chest forms a double; third chest refused (the cell
reverted to the wall planks it replaced); a torch beside the placed furnace
wall-mounts onto it (94, -X first); pillar(63) refused; inventory counts
exact (refusals consume nothing); the def stream shows the torch mini
columns + the five hidden leftovers.

**NEXT SESSION (user-requested): an in-depth bug & quality pass** over the
whole survival stack - both repos, all phases landed so far. Known candidates
to start from: buried-spawn death loops (grounding only fixes floating
spawns), the round-2 gdb multi-call inventory anomaly from the block-set
session (unreproduced), per-map skylight, container-click range checks, and
a sweep for stale comments like the `Server_ResetState` one above.

### Reserved message ids (`SurvivalNet.cs`)

Server → client: `HELLO 0x01`, `WORLDINFO 0x02`, `HEALTH 0x03`, `TIME 0x04`,
`MOB_SPAWN 0x10`, `MOB_MOVE 0x11`, `MOB_STATE 0x12`, `MOB_DESPAWN 0x13`,
`INV_FULL 0x20`, `INV_SLOT 0x21`, `CONT_OPEN 0x22`, `CONT_SLOT 0x23`,
`FURN_PROG 0x24`, `CURSOR 0x25`, `DROP_SPAWN 0x30`, `DROP_PICKUP 0x31`,
`DROP_REMOVE 0x32`, `BLOCKMETA 0x40`, `PLAYER_EQUIP 0x50`.

Client → server: `ATTACK 0x80`, `USE_ITEM 0x81`, `SLOT_CLICK 0x82`,
`RESULT_CLICK 0x83`, `CONT_CLOSE 0x84`, `HELD_SLOT 0x85`, `DROP_ITEM 0x86`,
`RESPAWN 0x87`.

Implemented so far: server→client `0x01` HELLO, `0x02` WORLDINFO, `0x03` HEALTH,
`0x04` TIME, `0x10–0x13` MOB_* (phase 3), `0x20`/`0x21`/`0x25` inventory
(phase 4 slice); client→server `0x87` RESPAWN, `0x80` ATTACK, `0x82–0x85`
inventory clicks (handled). The rest are reserved and, for inbound intents,
bounds-checked, capability-gated, and logged (handlers deferred).

## Config (per level, `Survival` section of `*.properties`)

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SurvivalMode` | `Off` / `Classic` / `Indev` | `Off` | Survival mode **and** the per-map activation gate |
| `SurvivalTheme` | `Normal` / `Hell` / `Paradise` / `Woods` / `Floating` | `Normal` | Indev world theme; `Floating` also sets the WORLDINFO floating bit |
| `SurvivalEnhanced` | bool | `false` | HELLO flag bit0 |
| `SurvivalCreative` | bool | `false` | HELLO flag bit1 |
| `SurvivalPvP` | bool | `false` | HELLO flag bit2 |
| `SurvivalDeathDrops` | bool | `true` | HELLO flag bit3 |

To make a map survival: set `SurvivalMode = Indev` (or `Classic`) in that level's
properties file, **or** use the `/Survival` command live (below).

### `/Survival` command

`MCGalaxy/Commands/World/CmdSurvival.cs` (rank Operator) edits the current level's
survival settings and applies them live — it saves the config and re-sends the
handshake (or a mode-off `SURV_HELLO`) to survival-test clients on the level, so
no rejoin is needed. Registered in `Command.RegisterAllCore()`.

- `/Survival` — show this level's survival settings
- `/Survival [off/classic/indev]` — set the mode (the per-map gate)
- `/Survival theme [normal/hell/paradise/woods/floating]`
- `/Survival [enhanced/creative/pvp/deathdrops] [on/off]` — set a flag

From console (no current level) it operates on the main level.

---

## Backward compatibility

- Stock Classic / CPE-only clients never advertise `SurvivalTest`, so
  `hasSurvival` stays `false` — they receive **zero** `SURV_*` bytes.
- Singleplayer / internal server never negotiates CPE exts → gate closed.
- On a non-survival map (`SurvivalMode = Off`) even a capable client gets no
  survival traffic; the map plays as plain Classic.
- Inbound: every message on `0xB0` is bounds-checked and dropped if the sender
  never negotiated `SurvivalTest`. A negotiated capability is a capability, not
  a permission — appliers, when added, must still re-validate reach / cooldown /
  slot / container access and correct the client authoritatively.

---

## Verification performed

- `dotnet build` of the core library and the CLI server: **0 errors**.
- CLI server **boots** cleanly on Linux (SQLite backend), generates + saves the
  main level, and listens on `25565` with no exceptions.
- Generated `properties/cpe.properties` shows `SurvivalTest = True` (advertised).
- Level config round-trips: setting `SurvivalMode = Indev`, `SurvivalTheme = Hell`
  parses and re-serialises with no warnings.
- **Socket-level end-to-end test** (a minimal Classic-protocol client driving the
  real running server, name verification off, main level `SurvivalMode = Indev`):
  - A **normal** client (no CPE) receives the "normal client" message and **no**
    `SURV_*` bytes.
  - A **survival** client (advertising `SurvivalTest` v1 in its CPE `ExtEntry`)
    receives the "survival client" message **and** the `SURV_HELLO` (`35 B0 01`)
    + `SURV_WORLDINFO` (`35 B0 02`) plugin messages on the wire.
  - The server console logs both connections with the correct classification.
- **Not** yet exercised: a real survival-test ClassiCube build (only a synthetic
  protocol client was used here). Pointing the actual client at the server is the
  natural next check.

---

## Build tooling added this session

- **`Makefile`** — `make` (core), `make cli`, `make all`, `make run`,
  `make clean`, `make hooks`, `make help`. Auto-detects the `dotnet` SDK.
- **`.githooks/pre-commit`** — builds the core library before each commit and
  aborts the commit on failure (skips gracefully when no SDK is present; bypass
  with `git commit --no-verify`). Install with `make hooks`
  (sets `core.hooksPath = .githooks`).
- **`.github/workflows/survival-support.yml`** — CI that runs on every push/PR to
  this branch (the stock `build.yml` only runs on master/ConsoleDriver). It
  produces the lean classic .NET Framework build via msbuild + Mono — the same
  layout as Visual Studio and the official releases (`MCGalaxy_.dll`,
  `MCGalaxy.exe`, `MCGalaxyCLI.exe` + bundled `MySql.Data.dll` /
  `System.Data.SQLite.dll`, no NuGet dependency tree) — and uploads `bin/Release`
  as an artifact.

Note on build flavors: the local `Makefile` and the pre-commit hook use the fast
`dotnet` build (net6/net8); CI uses the Framework build. Same source, two
packagings — the dotnet output additionally bundles MySql.Data 8.1.0's NuGet
dependency tree (BouncyCastle, Protobuf, LZ4, Zstd, …), which the Framework build
avoids by referencing the small bundled `MySql.Data.dll`.

### Command refactor: /Survival tools split into standalone commands

The operational tools were moved out of `/Survival` into their own commands
(the per-map config - `off/classic/indev`, `theme`, `visitors`, the
`enhanced/creative/pvp/deathdrops` flags - stays on `/Survival`, which is a
config command like `/Map`). Names that collide with existing core commands
(`/Spawn`, `/Time`, `/Give`, `/Inv`) take a `Surv` prefix; the rest are bare:

| was | now |
|---|---|
| `/Survival spawn`   | `/SurvSpawn` |
| `/Survival mobs`    | `/Mobs` |
| `/Survival spawner` | `/Spawner` |
| `/Survival time`    | `/SurvTime` |
| `/Survival inv`     | `/SurvInv` |
| `/Survival give`    | `/SurvGive` |
| `/Survival export`  | `/Export` |

Each is a self-contained `Command2` in `MCGalaxy/Commands/World/` (logic moved
verbatim from `CmdSurvival`, arg indices shifted down one since the subcommand
token is gone), registered in `Command.RegisterAllCore` and listed in
`MCGalaxy_.csproj`. `/Survival` with an unknown/removed subcommand now falls
through to its help, which points at the new tool commands. All Operator+,
type World - permissions unchanged from the parent.

Verified live: `/help` for all seven; `/SurvTime noon` sets the clock;
`/Spawner`/`/Mobs`/`/SurvSpawn zombie`/`/Export roundtrip2 gt1` run against
the console's main level; the console-arg guards fire; and the arg shift is
correct - `/SurvGive iron_pickaxe 1 CCUser` + `/SurvGive coal 32 CCUser`
landed id 257 x1 and id 263 x32 (confirmed via `/SurvInv CCUser`).

### Server-side review pass: 13 confirmed bugs fixed

An adversarial multi-agent review of the whole server survival stack (each
finding verified against the ClassiCube client oracle before it survived)
surfaced 19 real findings -> 13 distinct bugs, all fixed this pass:

**Concurrency / lifecycle**
- **Container.Slots data race (item dup/loss).** `contLock` only guarded the
  registry dictionary; the furnace tick (scheduler thread) and HandleSlotClick
  (network threads, incl. two players sharing one chest) read-modify-wrote the
  same `Container.Slots` array with no common lock. Now every container-slot
  path locks `contLock`: TickFurnaces mutates + streams under it (block flips
  collected and applied after release), HandleSlotClick's container branch does
  its read/apply/write/echo under it (click math factored into `ApplyClick`),
  StreamContainer snapshots under it. Deadlock-safe - nothing takes a send lock
  then contLock. Live-verified: a furnace still smelts end-to-end (iron ore ->
  ingot) with items loaded via the locked click path.
- **contRegistry leaked unloaded levels.** The `Dictionary<Level,...>` was never
  pruned, pinning every unloaded map's block array forever. New
  `PruneRegistry(loaded)` called from the mob tick's prune sweep.
- **Cross-level chest looting.** A player's open-container `OpenRef` survived a
  `/goto`, so a SLOT_CLICK from another level looted the container they left.
  Fixed both ways: HandleSlotClick/HandleResultClick refuse a ref whose
  `open.Lvl != p.level`, and SurvivalNet.OnJoinedLevel clears it on level change.
- **ClearMirror vs SyncMirror race.** `/Survival off` iterated a spectator's
  mirror `Ids` on the command thread while the mob tick mutated it. Added a
  per-MirrorState lock taken by both.

**Fidelity to the client oracle**
- **Chest lid used IsSolid, not the normal-cube rule** - glass/leaves/slabs
  above a chest wrongly blocked it. Now uses the shared `NormalCube` predicate.
  Live-verified: glass above -> opens, stone above -> blocked.
- **Furnace output capped at 99, oracle caps at 64** (matters for block results
  glass/stone). Now a fixed `FURNACE_OUTPUT_MAX = 64`.
- **Lava cushioned fall damage** - only water should. Reset changed to `if (inWater)`.
- **Void: -16 vs oracle -32, and applied on c0.30 maps.** VOID_Y -> -32 and the
  void branch gated on `indev`.
- **Liquid box missing the 0.4 vertical shrink** (ST_InLiquid). BoxTouches now
  insets minY/maxY by 0.4.
- **Creeper fuse latched** when it lost its target mid-swell (stayed swollen
  forever, re-detonated instantly on re-aggro). AttackAI now winds the fuse down
  every tick a creeper has no target.
- **Mining TNT gave a free TNT block** (infinite-TNT dupe, TNT is craftable).
  MiningDrops now drops nothing for TNT (the primed explosion is a phase-5 item).
- **Runtime Indev block defs could persist to blockdefs.json** via a stray /lb,
  then linger after the map went non-survival + a restart. Sync now strips any
  Indev-template-matching def from a non-survival map on load.

**Logic**
- **EnableHazards grounded the spawn under water/lava** (drown/burn respawn
  loop), and skipped the bottomless-column warning within FallHeight of the
  void. The descent now stops at the first solid OR liquid surface, warns
  (never grounds) over liquid/void, and checks that before the early return.

Six findings were adversarially REJECTED as not-real (e.g. a claimed nextMobId
cross-level race - ids segregate by level; a WORLDINFO == vs >= version gate -
no current desync at ext v2).

### Right-click item intents: hoe / seeds / food (phase-4 tail)

The `SURV_USE_ITEM` intent now carries held-ITEM uses, not just container opens:

- **Client** (`SurvivalTest.c`): `TryUseBlock`'s MP branch sends `USE_ITEM` for a
  held hoe or seeds (targeted at the clicked block), and `TryEat`'s MP branch
  sends a TARGETLESS `USE_ITEM` (sentinel x=y=z=-1, face 0xFF) for a held food.
  Both were previously no-ops in MP (deferred to the server).
- **Server** (`SurvivalInventory.HandleUseItem`): restructured around a
  `hasTarget` flag (a sentinel/out-of-reach coord = no target). With a target it
  runs container opens (unchanged), then `UseHoe` / `UseSeeds`; targetless (or
  after a non-matching target) it runs `EatFood`. New helpers, all matching the
  client oracle:
  - `UseHoe`: grass (no solid above) or dirt → farmland (`FromRaw(FARMLAND)`);
    the hoe wears 1 via `DamageHeldTool`; tilling grass has a 1/8 chance to yield
    a seed (v1: straight to inventory — the drop entity is phase 5).
  - `UseSeeds`: seeds on farmland (air above) → stage-0 crop in the cell above;
    one seed consumed.
  - `EatFood`: heal the food's `param` value (`SetHealth(cur+heal)`), consume one;
    an eaten soup leaves its empty bowl (soups don't stack).
  - `DamageHeldTool`: `ItemStack.damageItem` — shatter (empty the slot) once
    damage exceeds `32 << tier` (64 for flint&steel).
- `SurvivalItems` gained `IsHoe` / `IsFlintSteel` / `FoodHeal` / `MaxDurability`
  and the `SEEDS`/`SOUP`/`BOWL` id constants.

Deferred: **flint&steel → fire** (fire needs the phase-5 spread/burnout tick
system) and **mining-tool durability** (wear on block break, in the mine path).

Verified live (server-authoritative, via `/Export` + `/SurvInv` since gdb-injected
block placements desync the client's local view): tilling grass produced genuine
farmland (60) and cost the hoe 1 durability; planting seeds produced a genuine
crop (59) and consumed a seed (10→9); eating bread consumed the stack.

### Read-only for Classic clients on survival "visitor" maps (BlockPermissions)

User request: stop the flicker-then-revert when a non-survival (Classic) client
right/left-clicks on a survival map they can't build on - while Indev survival
clients keep full build/break.

The survival block bridge already CANCELS a visitor's edit server-side, but the
client shows the change locally first and only snaps it back when the revert
arrives (the "weird look"). The fix pushes the CPE BlockPermissions state up
front so the client never shows the edit:

- `SurvivalNet.BlocksReadOnly(p)`: true for a non-survival client on a survival
  map that isn't creative/Allow and isn't a referee - i.e. exactly the block
  bridge's "visitor" case (mirrors OnBlockChanging so wire perms and server
  enforcement agree). Indev survival clients, creative maps, Allow maps and
  referees return false (build normally).
- `Player.SendAllBlockPermissions` now forces place=delete=false for every block
  when `BlocksReadOnly` is true, so a Classic visitor gets a genuinely read-only
  map (no place, no delete) instead of the cancel-and-revert.
- `SurvivalNet.RefreshLevel` re-sends block permissions to everyone on the level,
  so toggling `/Survival off` / `visitors allow` flips the read-only state live.

No new config: it enforces the existing `visitors visitor` policy (the default)
more cleanly, client-side too. The block bridge stays the authoritative backstop.

Build-clean; live confirmation pending (the test rig was unstable this session).

## HANDOFF — next session pickup (write-up of in-chat plans)

Everything below was designed/decided in conversation but not yet built, so it's
recorded here as the durable bridge.

> **BRANCH — do NOT create a new one.** Keep committing and pushing to the
> existing feature branch **`claude/mock-survival-server-33jx1q`** on BOTH repos
> (`UmbreoClaw/ClassiCube` and `UmbreoClaw/mcgalaxy`). All prior work lives there;
> continue it, don't fork a fresh branch. Only start over from the default branch
> if that branch's pull request has already been merged (then reuse the same
> branch name from the latest default).

> **TOOLCHAIN / RIG — reinstall on a fresh container.** A new session gets a clean
> container, so the build/test toolchain (`.NET 8 SDK`, gcc/make + X11/GL dev libs,
> Xvfb, gdb, ImageMagick, python3) must be reinstalled. Exact install + build +
> rig-launch commands are in **`doc/survival-support/rig-setup.md`**, and the
> headless synthetic protocol clients (server testing without the graphical
> client) are committed under **`doc/survival-support/test-clients/`**.

### Live verification — DONE (rig recovered later in the session)
The rig briefly wedged (`ss` couldn't see :25565 - a sandbox network-namespace
quirk, the server WAS listening), then recovered. Both changes verified live:
- **Read-only visitor maps** ✅ — `test-clients/perm_client.py` (a non-survival
  CPE client) on gt1 got all 50 blocks `place=0/delete=0`; the fork survival
  client on the same map showed `Blocks.CanPlace/CanDelete = 1` (stone + Indev
  range). Classic = read-only, Indev = builds. Exactly as intended.
- **`/SurvivalGive [player] [item] <amount>`** ✅ — `diamond 3` gave 3, `coal`
  gave 1 (default), and the `/SurvGive` alias resolved. Player-first + default 1.

### Command rework #2 — `/inventory <player>` GUI (APPROVED, ready to build)
A GUI inventory viewer/editor, built on the existing container-GUI plumbing
(CONT_OPEN/CONT_SLOT/SLOT_CLICK). Locked design:
- New CONT_OPEN **kind = 5 (player inventory)**, slotCount 40 = **36 main + 4 armor**.
- Server: a variant OpenRef that targets a `PlayerInv` (not a Container tile
  entity). GetContSlot/SetContSlot/EchoContSlot branch on the kind so the view
  reads/writes the TARGET's inventory; echo to every viewer of that target.
- Permission tiers (MCGalaxy ranks): **Operator (80)+ = view** (SLOT_CLICK on the
  view rejected); **Admin (100)+ = edit** via an Admin extra-perm - chest-style
  drag model (items move between the target's inventory and the admin's own;
  a leftover cursor refunds to the admin on close).
- `/inventory <player>` becomes the command; supersede `/SurvInv` (keep as alias).
  A non-survival (Classic) viewer can't render a GUI -> fall back to the text dump.
- Client: handle CONT_OPEN kind 5 (title "<player>'s inventory", 40-slot layout).
  This is the part that NEEDS the graphical rig to verify.
- Risk note: this generalizes the tested container OpenRef system, so build it
  with the rig UP and re-test chests/furnaces after.

### Command rework #3 — `/spectate <player>` (design only)
Passive follow (like `/possess` but view-only) + mirror the target's open GUI to
the spectator read-only (reuses the #2 inventory/container streaming). Open
questions to settle first: first-person vs third-person; spectator hidden/frozen
to others; whether to mirror the target's HUD (health/hotbar). Do AFTER #2 since
it reuses the inventory-view streaming. Usable by Operator+.

### Block drops (phase 5) — design approach (researched, not built)
Client already has the full SP system (`SurvivalTest.c`: `DropItem` array,
`SpawnDropAtEx` with the genuine pop velocity, `DropPhysics`, `DropTryPickup`,
5-min despawn, death/mob/TNT drops) - all SP-gated (`if (ServerDriven) return`),
and there are NO MP handlers yet (SurvivalNet.c switch ends at CURSOR 0x25).
Reserved wire (ClassiCube SurvivalNet.h): `SURV_DROP_SPAWN 0x30` (dropId, item,
count, pos, vel, rot0), `SURV_DROP_PICKUP 0x31` (dropId, pickerEntity),
`SURV_DROP_REMOVE 0x32` (dropId, reason), intent `SURV_DROP_ITEM 0x86`.
Recommended design: **server owns drops** (spawn/pickup/despawn authoritative);
send DROP_SPAWN with initial pos+velocity and let the CLIENT run its existing
deterministic DropPhysics locally (drops settle to the same resting spot, so exact
sync isn't needed) while the server sends PICKUP/REMOVE. Un-gate the client's drop
render/physics for MP but make pickup/despawn server-driven; add MP appliers
HandleDropSpawn/Pickup/Remove. Rewire the mine path (currently straight-to-
inventory) + death drops + mob drops + TNT + the hoe-grass 1/8 seed to spawn drop
entities instead. Then landed-arrow pickups reuse this for projectiles (#3 of the
big three). NEEDS the graphical rig (entity physics/rendering) to verify.

### The three big features, recommended order
right-click intents ✅ done -> **block drops** -> **projectiles (arrows)**
(projectiles reuse drops for the landed-arrow item). All need the graphical rig.

## /Inventory GUI (#2) — DONE (server-only, no protocol change)

`/inventory <player>` opens a live view of another player's survival inventory.
Implemented entirely server-side by opening a **virtual chest** backed by the
target's slots — the client already renders chests, so there is **no client
change and no SurvivalTest ext-version bump** (reuses CONT_OPEN kind 1 / CONT_SLOT
/ SLOT_CLICK / CONT_CLOSE / CURSOR).

Design (SurvivalInventory.cs):
 * `CONT_PLAYERINV = 5` open kind; `OpenRef` gains `Player Target; bool CanEdit`.
 * A 36-cell chest view: cells 0..26 = target main storage (slots 9..35),
   cells 27..35 = target hotbar (slots 0..8) — the genuine inventory layout
   (storage on top, hotbar on the bottom row). `PlayerInvSlot`/`PlayerInvCell`
   map both ways. Armor (unimplemented in MP) is not shown yet.
 * `GetContSlot`/`SetContSlot`/`OpenSlotCount` proxy the target's own PlayerInv.
 * Bidirectional live echo: `EchoContSlot` (admin edit) routes through the
   target's `SendSlot`; `SendSlot`/`SendAll` fan the target's OWN changes out to
   every open view via `EchoPlayerViews`/`EchoAllPlayerViews` (O(online), guarded
   by cell mapping; player-inv views are rare).
 * `HandleSlotClick` gates the container path on `CanEdit` — Operator view-only
   (clicks rejected, no echo), Admin edits (items move to/from the admin's own
   inventory via the normal cursor model).
 * `OpenPlayerInventory(viewer, target, canEdit)` + `OnPlayerDisconnect`
   force-closes viewers when their target leaves (registered in CorePlugin).

Command: `CmdInventory` (name Inventory, alias SurvInv, defaultRank Operator,
ExtraPerm[0]=Admin "can move/edit"). Replaced CmdSurvInv (removed). A non-survival
viewer or the console falls back to the old text dump (`DebugDump`).

Concurrency: admin edits run under contLock; the target's own click/block-bridge
mutations don't — a simultaneous same-slot edit can lose one update (self-heals
on resync). Same accepted race as /SurvivalGive; documented on OpenPlayerInventory.

Live-verified (two synthetic survival clients, doc/survival-support/test-clients/inv_test.py):
 * Owner viewer: CONT_OPEN(1,36); target's stone→cell 27, dirt→cell 28; "editable";
   pickup cell 27 → cursor 30 + cell cleared + TARGET's slot 0 cleared live;
   deposit into the admin's own slot 9; close resyncs.
 * Operator viewer: same stream, "view-only", SLOT_CLICK rejected (no echo).

FUTURE POLISH (not v1): a bespoke player-inventory panel/title on the client
(currently it renders as a chest) + showing/editing the target's armor slots.

Test rig notes: the server enforces `verify-admin-perm` (admin-verification) —
elevated ranks must `/pass` before elevated commands; for headless synthetic
tests set `verify-admin-perm = 127` in properties/server.properties (reverted
after). The console FIFO must be a REGULAR file followed by `tail -n0 -f`
(a named pipe blocks on open-for-write with no reader); guard every `pkill`
with `|| true` (the rig shell has errexit).

## /Inventory GUI (#2) — UPGRADE: dedicated 40-slot panel + armor + dual-inventory (SurvivalTest v3)

The chest-fallback view was replaced by a bespoke player-inventory panel. This is
a WIRE change: SurvivalTest ext v2 -> v3, new CONT_OPEN kind 5 (CONT_PLAYERINV).

Server (mcgalaxy):
 * CPESupport.cs: SurvivalTest ext version 2 -> 3.
 * SurvivalNet.cs: added `SurvVer(p)` (Session.Supports is EXACT-match, so probe
   high->low for a `>=` gate) and migrated the WORLDINFO v2-layout check to
   `SurvVer(p) >= 2` (a bare `Supports(_,2)` would go false for a v3 client and
   regress floating-map levels).
 * SurvivalInventory.cs: PLAYERINV_SLOTS 36 -> 40. Cell map now: 0..26 target
   main storage (9..35), 27..35 hotbar (0..8), 36..39 armor (100..103, cell 36=
   boots .. 39=helmet). PlayerInvCell handles armor; SendSlot fans armor changes
   out too. OpenPlayerInventory sends kind 5/40 to v3 clients, kind 1/36 (chest
   fallback) to v2.

Client (ClassiCube):
 * Protocol.c: SurvivalTest advertised v3 (client gate at SurvivalNet.c is already
   a `>=` so no other change).
 * IndevTest.h: new INDEV_CONTAINER_PLAYERINV = 3 (internal; wire kind 5 maps to
   it in SurvivalNet_HandleContOpen). The rest of IndevTest.c already generalises
   to a 40-cell net-container (NetContOpen/NetContSlot/ContainerSlot/SlotCount).
 * Screens.c: ContainerCells returns 40; ContainerSlotXY lays the 40 cells onto
   the genuine inventory.png pocket layout (storage (8,84), hotbar (8,142), armor
   column (8, 8/26/44/62) helmet-on-top); guiTex -> InvGuiTex; a new panel branch
   composites inventory.png (top, target's 40) + the container.png player strip
   (bottom, viewer's own 36) = the dual-inventory window; Layout sizes panelH to
   166+96 and puts the viewer's own strip at 166+14 / 166+72; a label branch puts
   the "Inventory" caption above the own strip. The target paperdoll window is
   left empty (the client isn't told whose inventory it is). A v2 client still
   gets the chest fallback.

Docs: networking-plan.md CONT_OPEN kind list (kind 5 = player-inv, 40 cells, v3);
survival-handshake.md ext-version line -> v3.

Verified:
 * WIRE (test-clients/inv_test.py, viewer advertises SurvivalTest v3): CONT_OPEN
   (5,40); target stone->cell 27, dirt->cell 28; edit path picks up cell 27 and
   drops into ARMOR cell 39 -> target slot 102 (armor) set live + slot 0 cleared.
 * RENDER (graphical rig, gdb-injected NetContOpen(3,40)+NetContSlot samples,
   screenshot): armor column (helmet top / boots bottom), 3x9 storage grid, hotbar
   row, and the viewer's own empty inventory strip below all render in the correct
   positions - the two textures composite cleanly.

Minor cosmetic follow-ups (not blocking): the composited panel is tall (two
stacked textures) so at large inventory-scale settings the own hotbar row nears
the window edge; the target paperdoll window is empty; a small seam sits between
the two textures. Also a future nicety: send the target's name in CONT_OPEN so
the panel can title itself.

## /Inventory panels: rework to two side-by-side screens + target model

Two follow-up refinements after the first panel cut:
 1. The stacked inventory.png-over-strip composite read as broken; replaced with
    TWO inventory panels side by side (target left, viewer right). The real cause
    of the "one combined panel" look was the NON-TEXTURED fallback path (the rig
    and likely the client lack gui/inventory.png), which had no PLAYERINV case and
    drew a single panel spanning both halves - Screens.c now draws two separate
    flat panels there too. Both the textured and fallback paths render two panels.
 2. The target paperdoll (left panel) now shows the TARGET player's model.

Server (mcgalaxy):
 * EntityList.TryGetVisibleID(entity, out id) - new public getter for the id a
   viewer currently sees an entity as.
 * SurvivalNet.SendPlayerInvOpen(viewer, slots, targetEntityId) - CONT_OPEN kind 5
   now carries [3]=target entity id.
 * OpenPlayerInventory sends viewer.EntityList.TryGetVisibleID(target) (0xFF when
   the target isn't visible to the viewer - a different level - so no model).

Client (ClassiCube):
 * IndevTest: indev_netContTargetId + NetContTarget()/NetContTargetId(), reset on
   NetContOpen/CloseContainer. SurvivalNet_HandleContOpen kind 5 reads data[3].
 * Screens.c: SurvivalInv_RenderDoll refactored into RenderDollAt(entity, box) +
   a local-player wrapper. The doll gate renders the local player in the right
   panel and, for PLAYERINV, the target entity (Entities.List[targetId]) in the
   left panel when visible. Its two hardcoded panelX+51 model anchors became the
   box-relative boxX+25 (identical for the single panel). The left doll box gets
   its own recessed frame in the fallback path.

Verified in the graphical rig with TWO real clients (Adm viewer + Tgt2 target, so
Tgt2 spawns as a real entity - synthetic clients do NOT spawn as entities): the
clean real flow `/inventory Tgt2` -> OpenKind=PLAYERINV, TargetId=0, two panels
with BOTH player models in their doll windows. (Injection tests mislead here: a
prior gdb-injected panel left over the real command confuses the screen state -
always test the real flow from a fresh client.)

## /Inventory: cross-map + offline gates

CmdInventory now gates by locality/rank (all via ExtraPerms, so configurable):
 * perm 1 = edit (Admin) - existing.
 * perm 2 = view players on OTHER maps (Admin). Operators may only view a target
   on their OWN map: `if (target.level != p.level && !HasExtraPerm(p, rank, 2))`
   -> denied with "operators can only view inventories on their own map". Console
   (no map) is exempt.
 * perm 3 = view OFFLINE players (Admin) - forward declaration for when survival
   inventories persist; FindMatches is online-only today, so an offline name still
   falls through its "not found". Documented in Help + a hook comment.

Cross-map admin views work because the panel is the viewer's; the target's items
stream regardless of map, and the target paperdoll is simply absent (the target
isn't spawned to a viewer on another map - server already sends 0xFF then).

Verified live (Op viewer on gt1, Bob /goto'd to map2): operator cross-map ->
denied (no CONT_OPEN); Owner cross-map -> CONT_OPEN(5,40) + editable; operator
same-map -> allowed.

## Command rename: economy /Give -> /Payout, survival give -> /Give

Freed the short /Give for the survival item-give command (the one people reach
for most on a survival server):
 * Economy give (Commands/Economy/CmdGive.cs) -> renamed class+file CmdPayout,
   name "Payout", shortcut "Gib" kept. Registration (Command.cs) + csproj updated.
 * CmdSurvivalGive: name "SurvivalGive" -> "Give"; old names kept as aliases
   (SurvivalGive, SurvGive) so existing usage/scripts still work. defaultRank
   stays Operator. /Survival tools help updated to list /Give.

No collision: economy give's old name is vacated before the survival command
claims it. Economy transaction logic is unchanged (EcoTransactionType.Give enum).
Verified live: server boots with no registration errors; /help give -> survival
give, /help payout -> economy give.

## /Spectate (#3) - follow + live read-only inventory mirror

CmdSpectate (Commands/World/CmdSpectate.cs, name "Spectate" / shortcut "Spec",
World type, Operator, SuperUseable=false). Thin orchestrator over two tested
pieces:
 * Movement = /Follow (Command.Find("Follow").Use) - it hides the spectator,
   rank-checks (can't follow a higher rank), and TPs cross-map to the target.
 * Live inventory = OpenPlayerInventory(p, target, canEdit:false) - the read-only
   /Inventory panel, live via EchoPlayerViews.

Gating (matches /Inventory): survival-map only (SurvivalMode != Off) so it reads
as a survival tool; operators spectate on their own map, admins cross-map (extra
perm 1). Classic clients are allowed - OpenPlayerInventory returns false for a
non-survival client so they just follow ("follow only" in the message).

Flow: `/spectate <player>` follows + opens the mirror; `/spectate` or
`/spectate stop` unfollows (Follow toggles off) + ForceCloseView closes the panel
(new SurvivalInventory.ForceCloseView -> CONT_OPEN kind 0). Re-running on the same
target keeps the follow and just re-opens the panel (SPEC_KEY guards the toggle).

Verified (synthetic v3 Op, test-clients/spectate_test.py): /spectate Bob ->
CONT_OPEN(5,40) + "Now spectating Bob (inventory mirrored)" (the panel opening
proves p.following was set, i.e. follow engaged); /spectate stop -> CONT_OPEN(0,0)
+ "Stopped spectating". The panel render + follow are the already-verified
/Inventory panel and stock /Follow.

FUTURE: a dedicated single-panel spectate view (today it reuses the two-panel
/Inventory layout, so the spectator's own empty inventory shows on the right);
optionally mirror the target's OPEN containers/crafting in sync (the "full GUI
mirror" option), and a per-map-owner /os spectate for owners who aren't operators.

## /Spectate single-panel polish (solo flag)

/Spectate now opens a single-panel view (just the target) instead of the two-panel
/Inventory layout. Implemented as a `solo` flag on the existing CONT_OPEN kind 5
(no new kind): SendPlayerInvOpen gained msg[4]=solo; OpenPlayerInventory gained a
`solo` param (default false); CmdSpectate passes solo:true, /Inventory stays false.

Client (all branch on IndevTest_NetContIsSolo(), set from data[4]): layout draws
one 176-wide panel (not 176+16+176); render draws one inventory.png panel (or one
flat panel in the fallback) with only the TARGET's doll box; DisplayCount/
DisplaySlot/HitSlot show ONLY the target's 40 container cells (no viewer's-own
slots); the doll gate skips the viewer doll and keeps the target's. /Inventory
(solo=0) is untouched.

Verified (graphical rig, gdb-injected NetContOpen(3,40)+NetContTarget+NetContSolo(1)
+samples): a single centered panel with the target's model, armor/storage/hotbar,
and no viewer inventory.


## Block drops (phase 5a) - DONE: mine/toss -> drop entity -> proximity pickup

Mining a block (and the Q-toss) now spawns a real physical drop entity that the
player walks over to collect, instead of teleporting the yield straight into the
inventory. New server file **`Network/SurvivalDrops.cs`**; new client appliers +
MP tick in `SurvivalTest.c`/`SurvivalNet.c`. Wire ids were already reserved
(`SURV_DROP_SPAWN 0x30`, `_PICKUP 0x31`, `_REMOVE 0x32`); no ext bump (still v3).

**Division of labour** (the server can't run ClassiCube's collision engine):
- SERVER owns the LOGICAL drop. `SurvivalDrops` keeps a per-level registry
  (`Dictionary<Level,LevelDrops>` + a lock, pruned on unload next to the mob/
  container registries). Each `Drop` has an id (u16 wire key), block/item id,
  count, a settled feet-space X/Y/Z, an Age and a PickupDelay counter, and rot0.
- `SpawnMined(p,lvl,x,y,z,view,held)` replaces the old `AddOne` loop in
  `SurvivalInventory.OnBlockChanging`'s mine branch. Indev rolls the genuine
  `SurvivalItems.MiningDrops` table (harvest gating, grass->dirt, ore->item, seed
  rolls) and spawns one drop entity per item; c0.30 drops the block itself.
- `Spawn(...)` settles Y by scanning straight down for the first solid block
  (`SettleY`, using `CollideType.IsSolid`) and streams `SURV_DROP_SPAWN` with the
  SPAWN pos + a genuine pop velocity (Item ctor: xd/zd +/-2 b/s, yd +4 b/s) purely
  for the client's visual arc. The settle point is the pickup centre.
- `Toss(p,slot,whole)` handles `SURV_DROP_ITEM`: `SurvivalInventory.TakeForToss`
  removes the item + echoes the slot, then the drop is flung along the player's
  look vector (Vec3_GetDirVector replicated server-side from p.Rot bytes) with a
  40-tick self-pickup delay (mined uses 10).
- `Tick(lvl)` runs on the 20 TPS mob tick (added next to `TickFurnaces`): ages
  every drop, counts down PickupDelay, awards it, despawns at 6000t.

**Player-to-player semantics** (what the user asked about):
- WHICH player wins a contested pickup: `FindPicker` walks the level's survival
  watchers IN ORDER and returns the FIRST within `bb.grow(1,0,1)` reach (h^2 <=
  1.35^2, feet dy in [-0.5,2.0]) with inventory room - matching genuine
  `Player.tick`'s `findEntities` sweep (tick order, no distance tiebreak).
- PICKUP DELAY: the `delayBeforeCanPickup` counter lives on the DROP, so during
  the window NOBODY may collect it. That is exactly what lets a player toss a
  stack to a friend (40t) without instantly re-vacuuming it.
- Pickup is whole-stack only (`SurvivalInventory.PickUp` checks `HasRoomFor`
  first, no partial-remainder re-count over the wire); a full inventory leaves the
  drop for someone else / later.
- `SURV_DROP_PICKUP` is fanned PER-VIEWER: the picker gets pickerEntityId=255
  (ENTITIES_SELF_ID -> its own body), every other watcher gets the picker's Classic
  entity id AS THEY see it (via `EntityList.TryGetVisibleID`), so their client
  animates the item flying into the right body. Server-authoritative: no client
  ever self-awards (anti-dupe / anti-reach-hack).

**Client** (`SurvivalTest.c`): `struct DropItem` gained `net`/`netId`/`pickupTarget`.
`SurvivalTest_NetDropSpawn/Pickup/Remove` feed the existing `st_drops` pool;
`SurvivalTest_TickNetDrops(delta)` runs in the ServerDriven branch (next to the
puppet-mob tick) - it runs the drop's LOCAL physics + spin/bob + Indev lava/water
visuals, but NEVER local pickup, lifetime despawn, or fire-destroy (the server owns
those, and burning a net drop locally would desync). Pickup eases toward the picker
body captured on `DROP_PICKUP`. `SurvivalNet.c` decodes 0x30/0x31/0x32 (pos coord*32,
vel coord/sec*512). Rendering is the unchanged SP `SurvivalTest_RenderDrops` (gated
only on `SurvivalTest_Enabled`, called unconditionally in `Render3DFrame`).

**Verified** (synthetic protocol clients, `test-clients/drops_test.py` +
`drops_pvp.py`):
- Single miner: break grass (80,30,34) -> `DROP_SPAWN {id 1, item 3 (dirt), pos
  (80.5,30.5,34.5), vel vy=4.0}`; walk on -> `DROP_PICKUP {id 1, picker 255}` +
  `INV_FULL [(0, 3, 1)]`. Full mine->drop->pickup->inventory round trip.
- Two players on one spot: both get the shared `DROP_SPAWN`; Alice (first in tick
  order) wins with picker=255 + the inventory echo; Bob sees the SAME drop id
  picked up by picker=0 (Alice's id from his view) and gets NO inventory; exactly
  ONE player collects (no dupe). Pickup fired ~514 ms after spawn = ~10 ticks,
  confirming the mined delay gate.
- Client render path proven live: a graphical client on the survival map (so
  ServerDriven=true) + gdb-injected `NetDropSpawn`s -> a gdb probe of `st_drops`
  showed all drops active with `net=1`, correct ids/counts, and physics running
  (spawned at y=33.3, settled to the floor y=32.0). `SurvivalTest_Enabled=1` and
  `RenderDrops` is unconditional, so they draw. A beauty-shot of them on-screen was
  blocked only by the headless rig (the client spawned enclosed and gdb can't
  redirect its interpolated camera down to the floor) - not a code issue.

Test-client note: fixed a latent size-table bug shared with the older clients -
Classic opcode 0x0a (relative position update, no orientation) is 4 payload bytes,
not 5; it only bites once mobs/players are actually moving (mob streaming triggers
it), which is why the earlier static tests never desynced.

Still pending in phase 5: mob-death drops (`indevDeathDrop`), chest scatter, TNT
drops (all just call `SurvivalDrops.Spawn`), player death scatter
(`SurvivalDeathDrops`), and then projectiles (arrows).


## Phase 5b - the rest of the drop sources - DONE

Wired every remaining drop source onto the proven `SurvivalDrops.Spawn` path
(`SpawnScatter` = N single-item drops each with a pop; `SpawnStack` = one drop
carrying a whole stack; `MinedDelay(lvl)` = 10t Indev / 0 c0.30):
- Mob death (`SurvivalMobs.KillMob`): Indev 0-2 of the mob's death item
  (`indevDeathDrop`: zombie feather 256+32, skeleton arrow 256+6, pig porkchop
  256+63, creeper gunpowder 256+33, spider string 256+31; sheep none); c0.30
  pig/sheep 1-2 brown mushrooms (Block.Mushroom).
- Sheep shear (`HandleAttack`): Indev 1+rand(3) GRAY cloth at head height + takes
  the hit; c0.30 1-3 WHITE cloth, shear replaces the hit.
- Container scatter (`SurvivalInventory.ContainerRemoved`): a mined chest/furnace
  drops each stored stack as one drop at the block centre.
- Player death (`SurvivalNet.OnPlayerDied`): SurvivalDeathDrops (and not creative)
  scatters main+craft+armor+cursor at the corpse then clears them (`DeathScatter`).
- Explosion drops deferred: server explosions (`CreeperExplode`) only damage
  entities - no block-destruction trigger exists yet.

Verified live (synthetic clients): pig death -> item 319 (raw porkchop) x1-2 per
rand(3); sheep shear -> item 35 (gray wool) x2 at head height; sheep death drops
nothing.


## Phase 5c - PROJECTILES (arrows) - DONE

New server file **`Network/SurvivalArrows.cs`** + client MP appliers. A player
Tab-fire (c0.30) / bow use (Indev) and a skeleton's shot become server-owned
Arrow entities that fly the genuine c0.30 `Arrow.tick` model, stick into blocks,
and hit players/mobs for authoritative damage. New wire (no ext bump, ids were
free): `SURV_ARROW_SPAWN 0x33`, `_STICK 0x34`, `_REMOVE 0x35`, `_AMMO 0x36`,
intent `SURV_FIRE_ARROW 0x88`.

Division of labour mirrors drops: the SERVER owns each arrow's flight authority
(block-stick + every hit) and the ammo; the client seeds an `st_arrows` entry and
simulates the SAME c0.30 flight (`SurvivalTest_TickNetArrows`, MP-only, no local
collision) so the arc stays in lock-step until a STICK (snap+freeze) or REMOVE.
- Velocity is per-TICK (genuine Arrow units); wire vel = blocks/tick × 1024 (i16),
  pos = coord × 32. Spawn also carries `type` (0 player / 1 mob) + `gravity` (=1/
  force, u8×100) so the client's flight matches exactly.
- `FireFromPlayer` (SURV_FIRE_ARROW): c0.30 spends a counted quiver arrow
  (`Ammo` in Extras, 20..99, streamed as SURV_ARROW_AMMO); Indev spends an arrow
  item from the inventory (`SurvivalInventory.ConsumeArrow`, id 256+6). Aim is sent
  as i16 hundredths-of-degrees (yaw as u16 0..36000, pitch signed) for precision.
- `FireFromMob` + skeleton AI: a targeted skeleton (dist<24, on ground) has a 1/30
  per-tick chance to loose an arrow (type 1, damage 3, force 1.0) with the genuine
  asymmetric spread (yaw +/-22.5, pitch biased upward).
- `Tick`: c0.30 drag(0.998) + speed-scaled gravity, substep sweep (0.2/step) for
  block-stick (`SolidOverlap`) and entity-hit (`HitEntity` -> players via
  `DamagePlayer`, mobs via new `SurvivalMobs.TryArrowHitMob` -> HurtMob + aggro).
  The shooter is ALWAYS excluded from its own arrow (no blanket grace window - a
  close target still hits). Stuck player arrows are pickable within ~1.35 blocks
  (c0.30 refunds ammo, Indev gives an arrow item), then REMOVE reason 2. Player
  stuck arrows despawn after 300t at 1% / tick; mob arrows after 20t.

Client: `struct ArrowEntity` gained `net`/`netId`; `SurvivalTest_NetArrowSpawn/
Stick/Remove` + `NetSetArrowCount` feed `st_arrows`/`st_playerArrows`;
`TickNetArrows` runs the flight in the ServerDriven branch (next to the puppet/
drop net ticks). `SurvivalTest_TryShootArrow` (c0.30 Tab) and `TryUseBow` (Indev)
now send SURV_FIRE_ARROW in MP instead of early-returning. Rendering is the
unchanged SP `SurvivalTest_RenderArrows` (gated only on Enabled).

Verified live (synthetic clients on a temporarily-c0.30 gt1 for the free quiver):
- Fire straight down: ARROW_AMMO 20->19, ARROW_SPAWN {type 0, grav 0.83, vel
  (0,-1.2,-0.02)}, the arrow flew down and ARROW_STICK at the floor (y 33.5->32.3),
  then the player picked it up -> ARROW_AMMO back to 20 + ARROW_REMOVE reason 2.
- Two players: Archer's level shots hit Victim -> Victim HP 20 -> 0 (7 dmg each),
  each ARROW_REMOVE reason 1 (hit). Confirms HitEntity -> DamagePlayer.
- Skeleton fire observed: stray ARROW_SPAWNs originating away from the player were
  skeletons shooting at the clients (FireFromMob path).

Rig / test-setup notes (not product bugs): the console can't invoke the survival
`/give` (its Use never runs from console), so ammo for an Indev-map test can't be
granted that way - tested the quiver path on a temporarily-Classic gt1 instead
(reverted after). Synthetic clients spawn inside the gt1 spawn structure, so
level shots hit the wall until both players are lifted into open air. An early
bug where a blanket 5-tick owner-grace skipped ALL entity collision (letting the
arrow fly past a close target) was fixed to only ever exclude the shooter.

Still pending in phase 5+: block-destroying explosions (+ their 0.3-chance
drops), and the PLAYER_EQUIP (0x50) armor/held-item streaming for other players.


## Phase 5c fix - Indev arrow behaviour (Indev is the primary target)

The first arrow pass ran the c0.30 model in BOTH modes. Corrected so Indev is
faithful (genuine EntityArrow / EntitySkeleton / ItemBow), keyed on the map mode
on both sides:
- **Flight model** now branches (`Arrow.Indev`, client `IndevTest_Enabled`):
  c0.30 = drag 0.998 + speed-scaled gravity BEFORE the move; Indev = move FIRST,
  then drag (0.99 air / 0.8 water) + a flat 0.03 gravity. Server `Tick` and client
  `TickNetArrows` apply the identical order so the arc stays in lock-step.
- **Player firing**: Indev has NO Tab-fire - the server rejects a kind 0 (Tab)
  intent on an Indev map and only accepts the BOW (kind 1), consuming an arrow
  item; the bow arrow is SpawnIndev(speed 1.5, spread 1.0, damage 4, type 0) from
  the 0.16-sideways / 0.1-down offset eye. c0.30 keeps the counted-quiver Tab-fire
  (force 1.2, damage 7). The client already gated Tab out of Indev.
- **Skeleton firing** is now mode-split (was c0.30-params-in-both):
  - Indev (`IndevAttack`, genuine EntitySkeleton.attackEntity): bow within 10
    blocks on a 30-tick cooldown, stands still, NO melee. The RAW unnormalized aim
    (target feet for x/z, target-eye-0.2 for y, + horizontal×0.2 lob) goes into
    SpawnIndev(speed 0.6, spread 12.0, damage 4, type 0). NO death fire-burst -
    Indev skeletons drop 0-2 arrow ITEMS on death (already in KillMob).
  - c0.30 (`ClassicAttack`, Mob_ShootArrow): 1/30 per-tick arrow at any range on
    top of melee, force 1.0, damage 3, type 1, asymmetric spread.
- **Despawn**: Indev stuck arrows die at 1200t (any type); c0.30 keeps player
  300t+1%/tick, mob 20t. Spawn spread uses a Box-Muller gaussian server-side (the
  final velocity is streamed, so the client doesn't re-roll it).

Verified live on Indev gt1: a skeleton camped within range loosed arrows - all
type 0, grav 1.0 (Indev's unused field), speed 0.57-0.68 (=0.6 with the gaussian
spread), on the ~30-tick cadence. Confirms the Indev skeleton path + SpawnIndev.
The Indev player bow reuses the same verified SpawnIndev + Indev flight; it wasn't
independently live-tested only because the console can't grant arrow items for a
synthetic client (the c0.30 quiver path was fully tested earlier).


## Mob pushback + per-map spawn cap

Two mob-sim fixes (both server-side in SurvivalMobs; the client just renders the
streamed positions):

- **Pushback (Entity.push / applyEntityCollision)**: after Travel, every mob is
  shoved apart from overlapping PLAYERS (skipping `p.hidden` staff/spectators) and
  from other mobs, using the genuine formula (absMax->sqrt normalize, 1/dist boost
  clamped to 1, ×0.05, added to velocity so it lands next tick). Only the mob is
  pushed - players own their movement in Classic - which reads as "walk into a mob
  and it gets nudged aside". Fixes mobs stacking into one column and clipping into
  the player. `PushApart` + `HorizOverlap` (bb.grow(0.2)) + `PushVec` helpers.
  Verified: a pig I stood on was shoved 0.41 -> 1.15 blocks and settled right at
  the collision radius (no push once clear).
- **Spawn cap**: the old cap was `min(area*20, 256)` = ~80 on a 128^2 map, which
  swarmed. New per-map `SurvivalMobCap` LevelConfig (0 = auto = clamp(area*4, 8,
  40)); gt1 (area 4) -> 16. Stored on `LevelMobs.Cap`, recomputed each tick, and
  used by every spawner gate (InitialSpawnerRun / TopUpSpawnerRun / TrySpawnCluster)
  instead of the raw pool ceiling. `/Survival spawn` (DebugSpawn) still bypasses to
  the 256 pool. Verified: gt1 population climbed to 16 and held (was ~80).


## Other players' equipment (SURV_PLAYER_EQUIP 0x50) - armor + wire done, held render pending

Streams a remote player's worn armor + held item so their body renders it. Answer
to "do we need models on the server?": NO - the wire is pure item ids
([entityId][heldId:u16][armor[4]:u16 boots..helmet]); the CLIENT owns every armor
model (Armor1/2Model built in-code), texture (armor_*.png) and the render path,
keyed by item id. The server just reads 5 ushorts from the inventory it already
owns and fans them to viewers.

SERVER (done): SurvivalNet.SendPlayerEquip; SurvivalInventory.BroadcastEquip
(ComputeEquip = held from the selected hotbar slot + 4 armor ids; deduped on the
visible set via Extras[EQUIP_KEY] so it can ride the central SendAll echo without
spamming; per-viewer entity id via EntityList.TryGetVisibleID). Change triggers:
SendAll (pickup/give/craft/death), HandleHeldSlot, HandleSlotClick (self armor +
admin /Inventory edit of a target), place-consume, DeathScatter. NEW-viewer case:
the handshake CAN'T send equip (entity ids aren't resolvable yet - Entities.Spawn
fires OnEntitySpawnedEvent BEFORE SpawnRaw registers the id), so
SurvivalInventory.OnEntitySpawned queues the (viewer, equipped) pair and
SurvivalMobs.TickCore flushes it next tick (id now resolvable). This covers both
join directions (each side is spawned to the other).

CLIENT (armor done): SurvivalNet_HandlePlayerEquip -> SurvivalTest_NetPlayerEquip
stores held + armor[4] in st_netEquip[] per Classic entity id (cleared on map
change). IndevArmor_Render refactored to IndevArmor_RenderIds(e, ids) (id-driven,
non-zero = worn since counts aren't streamed); the local wrapper feeds it from
st_armor. The render pass (SurvivalTest_RenderMobs) loops Entities.List[0..SELF-1]
and draws armor on each entity we've been sent equip for.

Verified (synthetic two-client wire test, both join orderings): Bob sees Alice's
held id become 3 (dirt) when she picks a block up mid-session, AND on join when she
was already holding it (the OnEntitySpawned->flush path) - each with Alice's
per-viewer entity id. Armor rendering reuses the proven local-player IndevArmor
path (only parameterized by ids).

PENDING: the third-person HELD-ITEM renderer. A genuine third-person held-item
render does not exist in the engine yet (HeldBlockRenderer is first-person only);
SurvivalTest_RenderHeldItem is currently a documented no-op. The held id is
streamed + stored; drawing it (block mini-cube / items.png billboard at the
entity's right-hand transform) is the next piece.

## World growth + lighting (server-authoritative) — SurvivalGrowth.cs

Indev worlds now grow on the SERVER, streamed to every viewer as ordinary
SetBlock (0x06) — no new wire. New file MCGalaxy/Network/SurvivalGrowth.cs, a
C# port of the client's src/IndevTest.c growth handlers, ticked from the 20 TPS
survival mob loop (SurvivalMobs.TickLevel, Indev-only, under lock(lm.Mobs)) and
pruned on level unload alongside the drop/arrow registries.

Random-tick engine: the genuine World.tick payout (volume/200 random block
updates per tick, remainder carried) with the genuine `randId*3 + 1013904223`
LCG picker and power-of-two coordinate masks (biased picks on odd-sized maps are
skipped, as the client does). Handlers, all faithful ports:
 * TickGrass    — covered grass decays to dirt (1-in-4); lit grass seeds a
                  random nearby lit dirt block (whole-volume: any grass cell the
                  loop lands on can spread).
 * TickCrops    — the canBlockStay pop check (drops 1 wheat via SurvivalDrops if
                  a mature crop pops), then farmland-weighted / crowding-halved
                  growth advancing the CROPS_0..7 view ids.
 * TickFarmland — 1-in-5: solid cover reverts to dirt; water within x/z +-4 at
                  y..y+1 hydrates (FARMLAND->FARMLAND_WET); else moisture decays
                  and dry-with-nothing-planted reverts to dirt.
 * TickSapling  — the flower stay check, then light(x,y+1,z) >= 9 and the genuine
                  1-in-5 cadence; the 16-step metadata counter (no per-cell meta
                  server-side) is collapsed into one 1-in-16 roll — same mean
                  time-to-grow — then World.growTrees (trunk rand(3)+4, clearance
                  envelope, diamond canopy with corner trim, trunk logs).

Lighting model (what every growth light-gate reads):
 * Sky light — a top-down column scan finds the highest sky blocker; IsLit(x,y,z)
   == y > heightmap. Normal opaque cubes shade-from-below (heightmap parks one
   cell under them, so the surface block itself reads lit — grass must count as
   lit to spread); leaves and water clear that offset (shadow their own cell),
   matching IndevTest.c. Sprites/crops/torch/glass/air pass the sky. No stored
   heightmap or invalidation — growth queries are sparse enough to rescan.
 * Block light — a stored per-level flood cache (1 byte/cell), BFS from emitters
   (torch/wall-torch 14, fire/lava/lava-source 15, lit furnace 13) attenuating 1
   per cell into light-passing cells only. Re-flooded lazily (first tick, then
   once a second) so a placed torch lights crops within ~1s without hooking
   every block change. Eased sky value (day 15 / night 4) from SurvivalNet.
 * light(x,y,z) = max(IsLit ? easedSky : 0, blockLight) — the genuine
   getBlockLightValue, so crops/saplings grow at night beside a torch/lava.

Client gate (no double-growth): IndevTest_TickRandomBlocks now computes
`serverGrowth = SurvivalNet_ServerDriven()` once and skips grass/crops/farmland/
sapling locally in MP (Indev_ServerOwnsGrowth) — the server owns those. The
deferred client-only systems (leaf decay, fire, flowers/mushrooms, fluid
sources) still tick locally; the server doesn't handle them yet.

Verified (test-clients/growth_test.py, synthetic client on gt1, SurvivalCreative
temporarily on to plant): a dense sapling patch grew into trees — 123 Log/Leaves
blocks streamed as SetBlock — and grass spread onto exposed dirt (700+ dirt->grass)
and decayed under the new canopies (grass->dirt), all with a clean server log.
A placed farmland+crop+water bed ticked its handlers with no exceptions (crop
stage / farmland-moisture changes are custom view ids, invisible as fallbacks to
a client without BlockDefinitions, so they aren't distinguishable on the wire in
that test — but the shared light gate is the same one the observed sapling growth
proves working).

DEFERRED (backlog, unchanged): third-person held-item render; leaf decay, fire
and finite-fluid ticks server-side (still client-local); block-destroying
explosions.

## Server-side Indev block physics: leaf decay, fire, finite fluids — SurvivalPhysics.cs

The deferred client-only world sim is now server-authoritative too. New file
MCGalaxy/Network/SurvivalPhysics.cs (fire + finite fluids), plus a leaf-decay
handler in SurvivalGrowth, all ticked from the survival mob loop (Indev only,
under lock(lm.Mobs)) and pruned on unload. Every change streams as an ordinary
SetBlock (no new wire).

Notify model (the key server adaptation): the client drives fire/fluids by inline
recursion through its block-change hook; the server can't (a waking lake or a
collapsing fire field would blow the stack). Instead SurvivalGrowth.SetView
announces every server-authored change to SurvivalPhysics.Notify, which ONLY
ENQUEUES work (schedule fire, schedule/activate fluid, re-check neighbours) -
never sets a block inline. TickFire/TickFluids drain the queues next tick, which
IS the genuine scheduled-update model, so cascades spread over ticks instead of
recursing. Player edits reach the same Notify via OnBlockChangedEvent
(registered in CorePlugin); a map-load scan (setTickOnLoad) schedules pre-existing
fire + moving fluid the first time a level ticks.

 * Leaf decay (SurvivalGrowth.TickLeaves): a leaf with a non-solid block below
   and no log within x+-2,y-1..y,z+-2 decays, dropping a sapling on a 1-in-10
   roll - a chopped canopy peels from the bottom up.
 * Fire (BlockFire port): the age nibble store, the <=200/tick scheduled queue
   (tickRate 20), spread/ability tables (planks/log/leaves/bookshelf/tnt/cloth),
   updateTick (age, retire when nothing burns, consume neighbours down 100/up
   200/sides 300, jump to air cells to y+4), fireSpread from flowing lava,
   flint&steel-style ignition via placement. TNT is consumed but not detonated
   (block-destroying explosions still unported, same limit as CreeperExplode).
 * Finite fluids (BlockFlowing/Stationary port): spread-down-then-one-random-
   horizontal with volume-conserving donor removal (World.floodFill +
   fluidFlowCheck ported with the genuine x+(z<<10) layer packing), infinite
   springs from water/lava sources (-9999 sourced => never donates),
   stagnation (1/3 -> 1/3 retry, else water evaporates / lava petrifies to
   stone), water extinguishes fire + petrifies adjacent lava, lava ignites
   flammable neighbours, still<->moving wake on neighbour change. tickRate
   5 water / 25 lava.

Client (ClassiCube): the whole local Indev world sim is now gated off under
server drive - Physics_Tick returns early when SurvivalNet_ServerDriven() before
IndevFire_Tick/IndevTest_TickFluids/IndevTest_TickRandomBlocks, so nothing runs
twice or diverges. Ambient display ticks (fire crackle, lava embers, water foam)
are a separate path (IndevTest_RandomDisplayTicks) and keep running. The earlier
per-block growth gate inside TickRandomBlocks was removed in favour of this one
clean gate.

Verified (test-clients/physics_test.py + iso probes, synthetic Owner client on
gt1, SurvivalCreative+verify-admin-perm=127 for headless building):
 * FLUID: a water SOURCE floods thousands of cells (infinite spring, correct);
   a SINGLE water block stays one cell, falls, and dissipates - volume bounded,
   no runaway duplication. Water washing over fire extinguished it (incidental
   WaterContact confirmation).
 * LEAF: 9/9 floating (log-less) leaves decayed to air within ~16s.
 * FIRE: a wood platform + fire progressively burned 4/11 wood to air.
 * clean server log throughout.

Test rig gotcha (re-confirmed): promoting the synthetic account to build restricted
blocks (water/lava/fire) trips verify-admin-perm - the client gets "verify with
/Pass before you can modify blocks" and every edit reverts. The RIGHT fix is to
give the op account a password, not to weaken the server: once (from console or
the client) `/SetPass <pw>`, then each session the synthetic client sends
`/SetPass <pw>` (idempotent, or `/Pass <pw>` if already set) as its first chat
line before any edit. (Globally lowering verify-admin-perm = 127 also works for a
throwaway box but leaves the box unverified - prefer the password.) SurvivalCreative
= true on the map is still needed so the client may place freely. Any op-ranked test
account left in the DB needs its password set (or demote it back to Guest) before it
can touch blocks again.

DEFERRED (backlog): third-person held-item render; block-destroying explosions
(TNT detonation, creeper block damage).

## Mob AI: Indev A* pathfinding + creature AI (SurvivalMobs.cs)

The last mob-AI gap - Indev mobs used the c0.30 stride-forward chase (the
"pending the A* port" TODO). Now the server runs the genuine Indev navigation:
a port of level/path/Pathfinder.java (A* over walkable columns, step-up 1 /
drop-down 3, 16-block cap, single-block getVerticalOffset quirk preserved) plus
EntityCreature.updatePlayerActionState (Mob_IndevCreatureAI): resolve/acquire a
player target within 16 (spider only while its own cell is dark), attack it when
line-of-sight is clear (rayTrace port), then A* toward it (re-path 1-in-20) or
wander to the best of 200 getBlockPathWeight-weighted points (monsters prefer
dark, animals prefer grass), steering along the waypoints. Pathless -> the
existing BasicAI random wander. c0.30 keeps WanderAI + AttackAI unchanged.

 * SurvMob gains PathX/Y/Z + PathCount/PathIndex; the A* scratch (900 nodes,
   binary heap, 2048-slot hash) is shared static, safe under the single-threaded
   lock(lm.Mobs) tick.
 * IndevAttack now returns hasAttacked (skeleton bow-shot / creeper swell stand
   their ground; melee mobs keep striding) so the creature AI can hold position.
 * SheepAI split so SheepGrazeStep is an overlay both paths reuse.
 * Yaw uses the SERVER basis (atan2(dx,-dz)), not the client's atan2(-dz,dx) -
   the two conventions differ and mixing them would face mobs 90 degrees off.
 * Brightness reuses the growth light model via new SurvivalGrowth.LightAt.
 * Player hurt-aggro was already in HurtMob (a hit sets Target = attacker). Mob-
   vs-mob aggro from stray arrows is still a minor gap (arrows would need to
   carry the owner mob into HurtMob) - noted, not blocking.

Verified live (test-clients/mob_ai_test.py, /SurvSpawn at a synthetic Owner
client's feet on a flat lane): a creeper pathed 7.1 -> 2.7 blocks and detonated
on reaching the player; a zombie pathed 7.2 -> 2.9 into melee range (then
drifted off after killing the non-respawning synthetic target); a pig roamed the
terrain up to 22 blocks (grass-weighted passive wander). Clean mob-tick log
throughout. (Test-rig note: /SurvSpawn drops the mob at the caller's FEET, which
the classic position packet reports as eye-level - send the client's Y ~2 blocks
high so the mob lands on the surface instead of embedded in terrain.)

DEFERRED (backlog): mob-vs-mob aggro from arrows; block-destroying explosions;
third-person held-item render.

## Armor damage absorption (EntityPlayer.attackEntityFrom) — Indev

Worn armor now reduces incoming player damage (mob melee, arrows, environmental
- everything routes through SurvivalNet.DamagePlayer). A port of the client's
SP formula (oracle-verified), Indev-only:

 * ArmorValue (InventoryPlayer.getPlayerArmorValue): wear-weighted sum of the
   worn pieces' damageReduceAmount - (reduce-1)*remain/max + 1. Reduce is
   tier-independent (helmet 3 / chestplate 8 / leggings 6 / boots 3); durability
   is base{11,16,15,13}[piece]*3 << tier (cloth 0 / chain 1 / iron 2 / diamond 3
   / gold=chain 1). Added to SurvivalItems: ArmorMaxDamage / ArmorReduce.
 * DamagePlayer Indev branch (SurvivalInventory.AbsorbArmor): scaled = raw *
   (25 - armorValue) + carriedRemainder; HP lost = scaled/25, remainder carried
   between hits (Player.Extras). Every worn piece wears by the RAW damage even
   when the result rounds to zero; a piece past its max shatters (removed +
   BroadcastEquip). Also made the Indev invuln window a full miss inside the
   fresh half (no c0.30 delta damage), matching attackEntityFrom.

Verified live (armor_dmg.py, zombie melee on gt1): BARE took 5/hit and died in
~4 hits; FULL IRON took 1-2/hit (climbing as the pieces wore) and survived ~12,
the four pieces still worn - clean server log.

Test-rig note: the op account now has a password (physop / claudetest1). Tests
send "/Pass claudetest1" as their first chat line to verify the session before
any /Give or /SurvSpawn.

## Block-destroying explosions (World.createExplosion) — SurvivalExplosions.cs

Creeper/TNT blasts now carve terrain, not just damage entities. A port of the
client's Indev_CreateExplosion:

 * SurvivalExplosions.DestroyBlocks: 16^3 boundary rays seed a destroy set,
   each paying (resistance+0.3)*0.3 per occupied cell + a flat 0.225/step; cells
   passed while power>0 are cleared in genuine descending order with the 30%
   Indev drop roll (Block.getExplosionResistance table ported by view id -
   water/still-lava blast-proof at 100, flowing lava 1.2, bedrock 3.6M, stone
   group 6, dirt/sand 0.5, leaves 0.2, ...). Blasted chests/furnaces scatter
   (ContainerRemovedIfAny); drops route through SurvivalDrops.
 * SurvivalExplosions.Density / RayBlocked: the getBlockDensity shielding raycast
   used by the entity-damage half.
 * SurvivalMobs.ExplodeAt: the genuine density-falloff damage to every player +
   mob in 2*radius ((f^2+f)/2*8*diam+1, f=(1-d)*density) plus a velocity kick to
   mobs, then DestroyBlocks. CreeperExplode routes here (creeper radius 3 Indev /
   4 c0.30). SurvivalPhysics fire->TNT detonates via ExplodeAt (radius 4).
 * Opt-in: new per-map SurvivalBlockDamage config (default true). Off = entity
   damage still lands but terrain is spared, for protected builds. Removed blocks
   go through SetView -> lvl.UpdateBlock so they're streamed + BlockDB-recorded
   (undoable) and wake adjacent fluids.

Verified live (explosion_test.py, /SurvSpawn creeper at a synthetic client's
feet on gt1): the blast set 51 nearby blocks to air, spawned 19 drops, and
killed the point-blank player - clean server log.

UPDATE: the primed-TNT ENTITY + chain reaction is now implemented - see the
"Primed TNT entity + chain reaction (SurvivalTnt.cs)" section at the end. (This
paragraph described the v1 that detonated fire-caught TNT immediately.)

## Survival map persistence (SurvivalPersistence.cs)

A survival map's live simulation state now survives unload/reload. Four parts:

 * TIME OF DAY: per-map now (Level.Config.SurvivalTime), so it auto-persists in
   the level .properties - the shared static worldTime is gone; every survival
   level runs its own day/night clock and CurrentSkyLight/WorldTime/SetWorldTime
   take a Level. Verified: gt1 saved "SurvivalTime = 420" on /save.
 * GROWTH: free - the growth tick writes real blocks, which save in the .lvl.
 * MOBS + CONTAINERS: a per-level sidecar extra/survival/<lvl>.sur, written on
   OnLevelSave + OnLevelUnload, read on OnLevelLoaded. "mob type x y z yaw pitch
   health hasFur fuseState fire" lines (SurvivalMobs.SaveMobs/RestoreMob) and
   "cont x y z kind burn cook curBurn nslots id:count:dmg..." lines
   (SurvivalInventory.SaveContainers/RestoreContainer, chest/furnace tile
   entities incl. furnace smelt state). Restored mobs stream to players via the
   existing SendLevelMobs join sync; restored containers repopulate the TE
   registry (their blocks are already in the .lvl). Atomic-ish write (tmp+move).
 * PLAYER INVENTORIES: deferred (user choice) - session-only for now.

Verified live: 19 mobs saved to gt1.sur; after a full server restart (unload
saves, startup loads+restores) a joining client was streamed 16 restored mobs
(vs 0 without persistence), clean log. Container save/restore is the symmetric
path (build-verified; live GUI round-trip is a follow-up).

Wired in CorePlugin (OnLevelSave/Unload/Loaded). extra/survival/*.sur are
runtime data (gitignored bin tree).

## Tool durability + held-weapon melee (SurvivalItems / SurvivalInventory / SurvivalMobs)

`ItemStack.damageItem` ported server-side (Indev-only; c0.30 tools have no
durability). `SurvivalItems.ToolUseWear(id, entityHit)` mirrors the client's
`IndevTest_ToolUseWear`: a sword wears 1 per entity hit / 2 per block broken,
a shovel/pickaxe/axe the reverse, everything else (hoes, flint&steel) from
NEITHER (they only wear through their own onItemUse). Two hooks:

 * BLOCK BREAK: in `OnBlockChanging`'s mining branch, every non-air removal wears
   the held slot by `ToolUseWear(held, false)` (PlayerControllerSP.sendBlockRemoved
   runs onBlockDestroyed for EVERY removal, mined or instant). `DamageHeldTool`
   already shatters past `32 << tier` and echoes the slot; now guards amount<=0.
 * MELEE HIT: `HandleAttack` now deals genuine held-weapon damage
   (`SurvivalItems.MeleeDamage` = getDamageVsEntity: fist 1, tool base+tier,
   sword 4+tier*2) instead of a flat fist, and wears the weapon by
   `ToolUseWear(held, true)` via `SurvivalInventory.WearHeldForMelee`.

Build-verified; shares the already-live `DamageHeldTool` path (hoe wear).

## Primed TNT entity + chain reaction (SurvivalTnt.cs)

The DEFERRED primed-TNT entity is now real. A server-owned per-level sim
(mirrors SurvivalDrops/SurvivalArrows) with a new streamed entity:

 * WIRE: `SURV_TNT_SPAWN 0x37` [tntId:u16][pos:3xi16 *32][vel:3xi16 blocks/tick*1024]
   [fuse:u16] and `SURV_TNT_REMOVE 0x38` [tntId:u16][reason 0 detonate/1 defuse].
   Like arrows, the client seeds an `st_tnt` entry and simulates the SAME
   PrimedTnt hop/smoke/flash from the streamed seed - it never explodes locally
   (`SurvivalTest_TickNetTnt` in the ServerDriven branch; local SP defuse skips
   net entries). Streamed to joiners at handshake (`SendLevel`).
 * IGNITION (all call `SurvivalTnt.Ignite`, which clears the block + spawns the
   entity with the PrimedTnt ctor pop): mining a TNT block (full fuse, both
   modes - TNTBlock.getDropCount()==0 so no item drop), fire consuming TNT
   (`FireTryCatch`, full fuse - replaced the v1 immediate blast), and a blast
   clearing a TNT block (`SurvivalExplosions.DestroyBlocks`, short randomized
   chain fuse: Indev 10+rand(20), c0.30 5+rand(10)).
 * PHYSICS: gravity 0.04, AABB clip-collision (clipY/X/Z) against solid blocks,
   drag 0.98 + ground friction 0.7 - faithful to PrimedTnt.tick for the common
   pop+fall. Fuse post-decrements; at expiry `SurvivalMobs.ExplodeAt` runs the
   full blast (entity damage + `DestroyBlocks`), which chain-ignites more TNT.
   Ticked after the mob loop under lock(lm.Mobs); the descending iteration leaves
   chain-armed entries (appended) for the next tick, the genuine one-tick delay.
 * Fuse=80 Indev / 40 c0.30 (`DefaultFuse`); pool capped at 128/level.
   Transient, so NOT persisted across unload.

Verified live (fire -> TNT on a creative Indev gt1): full-fuse SPAWN (id=1,
fuse=80), detonation ~4s later (SURV_TNT_REMOVE), the blast re-primed both
neighbour TNT blocks with partial fuses (fuse=25 and 14), each detonating on
its own fuse, 402 blocks destroyed to air. ENTITY+FUSE / DETONATION / CHAIN all
OBSERVED. Mining-ignition shares the same Ignite() path (build-verified).

## Flint & steel + MP primed-TNT defuse (SurvivalInventory / SurvivalTnt / SurvivalMobs)

Two backlog items, both Indev/c0.30-faithful and live-tested.

FLINT & STEEL -> FIRE (ItemFlintAndSteel.onItemUse / IndevFire_UseFlintSteel):
 * Client (SurvivalTest.c ~7530): added `heldId == 256+3` to the MP `itemUse`
   gate so a right-click with flint&steel leaves as SURV_USE_ITEM (heldSlot,
   target xyz, face = Game_SelectedPos.closest) instead of doing nothing.
 * Server (SurvivalInventory.UseFlintSteel, dispatched after UseHoe/UseSeeds in
   HandleUseItem - Indev-only, non-creative, reach-checked upstream): steps ONE
   cell out of the clicked face (FACE_* XMIN0 XMAX1 ZMIN2 ZMAX3 YMIN4 YMAX5),
   and if that interior cell (>0 and <dim-1 each axis) is air, writes FIRE
   (SurvivalBlocks.FIRE=51) via lvl.UpdateBlock(Player.Console,...) - which the
   fire physics then spreads / uses to catch TNT. The item wears 1 (DamageHeldTool,
   shatters past 64) whether or not fire was actually placed - genuine.
 * TNT ignition is NOT special-cased: flint&steel just places fire, and the
   existing FireTryCatch -> SurvivalTnt.Ignite path handles the catch.
 * Verified live (physop on gt1, /Give 259): server debug confirmed face->cell
   air check, fire placed at the face cell, durability 0->1->2->3, and fire above
   a placed TNT caught it -> primed TNT (1,80). NOTE: a lone fire on a
   non-flammable block retires before the block queue flushes (coalesced), so the
   observable proof is the TNT catch / a flammable-neighbour burn, not the raw 51.

MP PRIMED-TNT DEFUSE (PrimedTnt.hurt with a Player attacker, c0.30 ONLY):
 * Client: FindNetTntHit ray-casts the net st_tnt entries; in ServerDriven +
   !IndevTest_Enabled, a melee swing that hits one sends SurvivalNet_SendAttack(2,
   netId) - targetKind 2 = primed TNT. The SP local defuse (TryDefuseTnt) is now
   gated `!SurvivalNet_ServerDriven()` and already skips net entries, so MP never
   double-acts locally.
 * Server: HandleAttack dispatches targetKind==2 (before the mob path, no
   lock(lm.Mobs) needed) to SurvivalTnt.Defuse(lvl, tntId, p). Defuse is gated on
   SurvivalMode.Classic (c0.30 only - Indev primed TNT "cannot be punched out"),
   reach-validates against p.Pos (6-block padded, like HandleAttack/USE_ITEM),
   removes the entry under lock(lt.List), sends SURV_TNT_REMOVE reason=1 (defuse,
   no burst) to watchers, and drops one TNT block (SurvivalDrops.SpawnStack).
   SendTntRemove already carried the reason byte (0 detonate / 1 defuse); the
   client's NetTntRemove maps reason 0 -> particle burst, 1 -> silent remove.
 * Verified live (physop on a Classic gt2, /Give 46): mine TNT -> SPAWN (id 1,
   fuse 40) -> SURV_ATTACK(2,1) -> REMOVE (1, reason 1) at +0.05s + DROP (46,1) at
   +0.09s, NO detonation (reason 0) and no blast. Clean defuse.

Wire: SURV_ATTACK (0x80) targetKind now 0 mob / 1 player / 2 primed TNT.

## Adversarial review of flint&steel + TNT-defuse (outcome)

A 4-lens verified review (concurrency, abuse/validation, oracle-fidelity, desync)
ran over the diff. The concurrency (defuse vs detonate double-free), security
(forged/out-of-reach/Indev ATTACK-2), and desync lenses came back CLEAN. Two
confirmed findings, both minor + Indev-only:
 * LOW - flint & steel on a WORLD-BOUNDARY cell: the server wears the tool
   unconditionally (genuine ItemFlintAndSteel.onItemUse), but the client SP oracle
   returned false BEFORE wearing on the non-interior early-out, so SP wore 0 while
   MP wore 1 at map edges. FIXED on the client (IndevFire_UseFlintSteel): the
   interior/air check now gates only the fire placement; the item wears + the click
   is consumed unconditionally, so SP == MP == genuine.
 * NIT (deferred) - MP flint & steel ignition is silent; SP plays "fire.ignite".
   This is the general server-authoritative trait (a Console UpdateBlock reaches
   the client as a plain SetBlock with no sound); replaying it would need a sound
   message. No state divergence - accepted limitation for now.

## PvP, player-inventory persistence, mob infighting (SurvivalMobs / SurvivalArrows / SurvivalInventory)

The last three roadmap features, all live-tested on gt1.

PVP (SurvivalPvP flag, already streamed as HELLO bit2):
 * Client: SurvivalTest_TryAttackMob now also ray-casts OTHER PLAYER entities
   (Entities.List, skip self) when ServerDriven && (ActiveFlags & 0x04), closest
   target under the crosshair winning across mobs/TNT/paintings/players, and
   sends SURV_ATTACK targetKind 1 with the per-viewer entity id.
 * Server: HandleAttack targetKind 1 -> HandlePvPAttack: gate on
   lvl.Config.SurvivalPvP, resolve the attacker's per-viewer id back to a Player
   (EntityList.TryGetVisibleID scan), reach-check (6 padded), damage =
   MeleeDamage(held) on Indev / flat 4 on c0.30 via DamagePlayer (runs the
   victim's armor absorption), weapon wears. Referees + dead players excluded.
 * ARROWS: player-fired arrows hitting players were UNGATED before - now they
   require SurvivalPvP; skeleton arrows always hit. Referees skipped.
 * Verified: gate off -> health 20 unchanged; /Survival pvp on -> 20->19 (fist).

PLAYER-INVENTORY PERSISTENCE (extra/survival/players/<name>.inv):
 * SaveInv on OnPlayerDisconnect (shutdown kicks everyone = restart coverage),
   LoadInv lazily inside Get() on the session's first inventory touch. Persists
   main+hotbar (0..35) + worn armor (99..102); craft grid + cursor stay
   session-only (genuine returns/drops those on GUI close). Atomic tmp+move,
   "s idx id count dmg" lines. Verified: 3 bread survived a full reconnect.

MOB INFIGHTING (Indev, EntityCreature.attackEntityFrom semantics):
 * HurtMob gained an attackerMob param: last attacker wins - a mob hit sets
   TargetMob (clearing Target) and vice versa; knockback comes from whichever
   entity landed the hit. TryArrowHitMob resolves the shooter mob from
   ownerMobId and passes it, so a skeleton arrow tagging another mob starts the
   fight. Mobs removed by despawn are marked Dead so TargetMob referrers drop
   ghosts.
 * IndevCreatureAI: a live TargetMob takes precedence over player hunting - the
   AI paths to/faces the victim mob and attacks via IndevAttackMob (creeper fuse
   extracted+shared as CreeperFuseStep; spider pounce, skeleton bow aim, melee
   all mirrored at the mob's coordinates). Melee retaliation re-targets the
   victim back, so fights are mutual. c0.30 AI untouched (no infighting there).
 * A permanent Debug log marks each retarget: "X #a now targets Y #b (infight)".
 * Verified live: rig leftovers produced a four-way skeleton war - mutual
   retargeting chains exactly as genuine (#18->#26, #27->#18, #26->#21, ...).

## Systematic audits: level parity, per-map light/clocks, unload saves (outcome + fixes)

A 4-lens verified audit (per-level isolation, per-map light, per-map clocks,
unload/save correctness) raised 23 findings; 14 agent-confirmed + 2 hand-
confirmed. FIXED in this pass:

 * CRITICAL - shutdown wrote NO sidecars: Server.cs unloads plugins BEFORE
   SaveAllLevels, so OnLevelSave was unregistered by save time. SurvivalNet.Stop
   now calls SurvivalPersistence.SaveAllLoaded() first: every loaded survival
   level's sidecar + settings (SurvivalTime) written while registries are alive.
 * CRITICAL - the MAIN level's sidecar was never restored (it loads before
   CorePlugin registers OnLevelLoaded) and the next save then overwrote it EMPTY.
   Fixes: (a) SurvivalNet.Start queues all already-loaded survival levels for
   restore (catch-up, mirrors SurvivalBlocks.SyncLoadedLevels); (b) restores now
   run on the SURVIVAL TICK thread (pending queue drained in TickCore before the
   prune sweeps) - which also kills the OnLevelLoaded-before-LevelInfo.Add prune
   race; (c) Load consumes the sidecar (deleted after restore, exactly-once);
   (d) Save refuses to write when NEITHER registry exists (pruned level) so an
   "empty" lie can never clobber a real sidecar - this also covers
   LevelActions.Replace, which removes the level from Loaded long before its
   unload-save runs. Verified live: restore->consume on startup, sidecar with 15
   live mobs written at shutdown, full loop twice, clean log.
 * HIGH - SurvivalPhysics fire/fluid schedules were mutated lock-free from
   player receive threads (OnBlockChanged -> Notify) racing the tick thread.
   All LevelPhys mutations now serialize on the LevelPhys monitor (re-entrant;
   Notify, Tick, RandomTickFire/Fluid).
 * HIGH - random-tick coordinate masks used dim-1 on possibly-non-power-of-two
   dimensions, knocking holes in the pick space (most cells never ticked on
   imported odd-size maps). Masks now span the next power of two with the
   bounds check rejecting overflow (and Y got its own shift).
 * MEDIUM - idle SurvivalTime was lost on unload/shutdown (SaveSettings only ran
   when blocks Changed): the unload hook + shutdown sweep now SaveSettings
   unconditionally for survival maps.
 * MEDIUM - flint&steel fire was never scheduled (Console UpdateBlock raises no
   OnBlockChangedEvent): UseFlintSteel now calls SurvivalPhysics.Notify.
 * MEDIUM - stock viewers went permanently full-bright after a map change (the
   per-player env-light dedup was never reset): OnJoinedLevel now clears it for
   ALL clients (SurvivalFallbacks.ResetEnvCache).
 * Sidecar writes use File.Replace (crash can't lose both copies).

DEFERRED (documented, lower priority): RefloodBlockLight full-volume rescan
once/second (perf, medium); spider lose-interest still uses the old sky-exposure
approximation (low); farmland at the top layer reverts (GetBlock(y+1) reads
Invalid, nit); McLevelImporter discards TimeOfDay (low); /SurvTime from console
reports success without a level (nit); sidecars orphaned on level rename/copy
(medium - needs rename hooks); stale "shared clock" comments.

## Deferred-fix pass + .mclevel round-trip upgrade

DEFERRED AUDIT FIXES, all landed:
 * Reflood perf: LevelGrowth.LightDirty - the once-a-second full-volume block-
   light reflood now runs only when a block actually changed since the last
   flood (SetView + player edits via SurvivalPhysics.OnBlockChanged both mark
   dirty; countdown clamped so it can't underflow). Quiet maps: zero rescans.
 * Spider light: SpiderBright uses the REAL light model (Brightness > 0.5,
   sky + block light - a spider in torchlight loses interest exactly where it
   refuses to hunt), while IsBright keeps skylight-x-exposure for undead
   daylight burn (torches must never ignite zombies) and despawn accel.
 * Farmland top layer: the solid-above check is now bounds-guarded (an
   unguarded GetBlock(y+1) read Block.Invalid = "solid" and always reverted).
 * /SurvTime from console: proper "per-map, use in-game" message.
 * Stale "shared/global clock" comments refreshed (SurvivalNet, networking-plan).
 * Sidecar lifecycle: OnLevelRenamed/Copied/Deleted move/copy/delete
   extra/survival/<map>.sur so name-keyed state follows the level.

.MCLEVEL ROUND-TRIP (closes the Phase-1 export/import gaps):
 * Exporter: the level's live mobs are written into Entities as genuine mob
   compounds (id Zombie/Skeleton/Pig/Creeper/Spider/Sheep, Pos = feet +
   heightOffset, Rotation, Health, Fire, sheep Sheared) after the LocalPlayer
   stub. SurvivalMobs.SnapshotMobs/HeightOffOf are the accessors.
 * Importer: Environment.TimeOfDay -> Level.Config.SurvivalTime (per-map clock);
   Entities + TileEntities are converted into extra/survival/<name>.sur ("mob"
   lines feet-space, "cont" lines with genuine item ids mapped back through
   FromIndev) - consumed exactly-once by the hardened persistence restore when
   the imported level first loads. No new registry paths: the import rides the
   same pipeline as normal persistence.
 * Verified live: /Export rtx gt1 -> /Import rtx -> /Load rtx: 15 mobs through
   NBT and back (positions float32-exact, fur preserved), TimeOfDay carried,
   sidecar consumed on load, zero errors.

## Command tidy-up pass (console gating + offline inventories)

 * /SurvTime: console now falls back to the MAIN level (the house pattern all
   other survival commands use) with an explicit "(console: using the main
   level X)" note, instead of rejecting; a non-survival level gets a "clock
   never advances" warning; the stale "shared clock" help text now says each
   map keeps its own.
 * /Inventory: the declared-but-unimplemented admin capability (extra perm 3,
   "view offline players") is real now that inventories persist - an exact
   offline name with a saved extra/survival/players/<name>.inv dumps read-only
   (checked before FindMatches so its not-found error doesn't fire).
   SurvivalInventory.HasSavedInv/DebugDumpOffline + LoadInvFile refactor.
 * Audited the rest: /Give, /Export, /Mobs, /Spawner, /SurvSpawn, /Survival,
   /Spectate all already null-guard console (mainLevel fallback or
   SuperUseable=false) and validate their targets - no changes needed.
   Console-tested live: SurvTime read/set on main, offline dump, mobs/spawner
   reports, zero errors.

## Fidelity re-check against the real sources (c0.30 jar + in-20100223 tree)

Both reference sources are now usable locally - the real c0.30_01c client jar
(Mojang's version manifest, read with `javap -p -c`) and EaglerPorts'
deobfuscated in-20100223 source - so fidelity claims can be settled from the
originals instead of recalled. Every pass over them has found something, and
twice what it found was an error in a fix made earlier in the same session.

 * Mob step-up: an audit claimed the CLIENT was unfaithful for giving mobs
   StepSize 0.5 and recommended removing it. The jar says `Mob.<init>` sets
   `footSize = 0.5F` and every mob descends from Mob - the audit had it
   backwards, and the SERVER was the unfaithful side. Ported Entity.move's
   step-up instead, and made block collision height-aware (a slab was a full
   cube to a mob, so a half-block step could never clear anything). Re-reading
   the Indev source afterwards caught two more approximations in that port: the
   grounded gate is `onGround || the downward move was clipped this tick`, and
   `ySize` (the ~3-tick step cooldown) was missing entirely.
 * Indev spawn light: the predicates were right, the gate under them was not.
   EntityMob/EntityAnimal.getCanSpawnHere both call super, and
   EntityCreature's adds `getBlockPathWeight >= 0`; for an animal that is
   `grass below ? 10 : brightness - 0.5`, and the brightness table crosses 0.5
   between light 11 (0.437) and 12 (0.525). Animals were spawning on lit
   stone/sand/gravel genuine refuses. Monsters carry the same gate but rand(8)
   already caps them at 7, so it can never fire.
 * c0.30 spawn light: `Level.isLit` is `y >= calcLightDepths' blocker`, pure
   sky exposure - c0.30 has no block light at all. We were feeding it the
   torch-aware combined value, so a lit cave suppressed spawns on a version
   with no such rule. Now shares the growth tick's sky heightmap, which already
   gets genuine's off-by-one right (the blocker's own cell reads as lit).
 * Skeleton death burst: count/yaw/pitch/force all matched Skeleton.access$000;
   the spawn height did not. Genuine is `y - 0.2F`, and Entity.y is not the
   feet - Entity.move recomputes it as `bb.y0 + heightOffset - ySize`.
 * Arrow type was flagged as possibly inverted. It is not: the ctor defaults
   type 0 and sets 1 only when the owner is not a Player, and the burst passes
   `level.getPlayer()`. Our `0 = player-fired` matches genuine directly.

## World-generator audit (LevelGenerator.java, pass by pass)

The terrain math holds up - the distort/octave stack and its constants,
Eroding's `((h - e) / 2 << 1) + e`, Soiling's use of the UNclamped var72/var31
pair while the heightmap gets clamped, Growing's thresholds and level-type
override order, the cave and ore worms (including the 12/16-vs-0.9 pitch-decay
asymmetry between them, which is genuine), the flood fill's power-of-two index
packing and its missing +Y spread, the World-replica notify order, swap,
tryToFall, findSpawn and growTrees all match, RNG draw order included.

Two constants did not:

 * **Torch light is 13, not 14.** `setLightValue` stores
   `(int)(15.0F * arg)`, and the torch registers `14.0F/16.0F` ->
   `(int)13.125` = 13. The lit furnace registers the identical value and was
   already 13 here, which is what gave it away. Inert in the generator, but
   SurvivalGrowth's runtime flood uses the same constant, so every torch was
   suppressing monster spawns out to radius 7 instead of 6.
 * **Still liquids never woke on a flammable neighbour.**
   BlockStationary.onNeighborBlockChange wakes to its moving id if a neighbour
   can flow OR if the block that just changed is in BlockFire's setBurnRate
   table. The practical case is shoreline trees: growTrees notifies the sea
   beside a trunk it just placed.

Two differences left alone on purpose: World.setBlock's edge-water rule is dead
code in genuine (its own bounds test excludes every border column before that
branch is reachable), and canThisPlantGrowOnThisBlockID also accepts farmland,
which the generator never produces.

## Generation-time mob population + the spawn-facing fix

 * **Spawn rotation.** generateHouse cuts the doorway into the -Z wall and
   genuine records rotSpawn = 180 to face it. The number does not carry over:
   Minecraft's look vector is `(-sin yaw, cos yaw)` so its 180 faces -Z, while
   ClassiCube's is `(sin yaw, -cos yaw)` so the same 180 faces +Z. Both
   generators copied the literal constant, so every Indev spawn - singleplayer
   included - put the player staring at the back wall. -Z is yaw 0 here.
 * **PrePopulate.** LevelGenerator's "Spawning.." phase, 1000
   performSpawning passes. The client had always done this, so an SP map and
   the same map served over the wire disagreed on day one. performSpawning
   already contains the generation-time case: its distance test measures from
   the level spawn when there is no player entity, which is why a generated
   world's mobs are never on the doorstep.
   Ordering is the whole difficulty. It runs after Run() (genuine puts
   Spawning last) and after ApplyLevelSettings (the spawner branches on
   SurvivalMode and reads the block defs Sync installs), inside a
   Pin()/Unpin() pair, and writes the sidecar itself rather than trusting the
   OnLevelSave that CmdNewLvl fires a moment later. The pin exists because a
   level being generated is not in LevelInfo.Loaded, so the 20 TPS prune sweep
   would drop every registry the generator touches within 50 ms, repeatedly -
   including SurvivalGrowth's light flood, which the spawner queries on every
   attempt.
   EffectiveCap is a per-player budget and there are no players yet, so it
   would resolve to one player's 32 whatever the map size; the genuine
   per-kind caps do the limiting instead.
 * **TrimExcessMobs** (was TrimExcessAnimals) now answers to three ceilings -
   both per-kind caps and lm.Cap - taking the mob whose nearest player is
   furthest away, never one inside the 32 blocks the genuine despawn roll
   protects, at a rate scaled to how far over the map is. A cull is a corpse
   flop with no loot; the c0.30 creeper-blast and skeleton-burst tails are
   !indev-gated so they cannot fire from it.
 * Live-verified on a CLI server: 128x64x128 inland seeded 44 mobs (40
   monsters + 4 animals, exactly its caps) with the nearest 33.4 blocks from
   the spawn house; 256x64x256 island seeded 176, again exactly cap; a
   load/unload round trip brought all 44 back out of the sidecar.
 * Client-side follow-up: Mob_IndevSpawnPass now takes its avoid point as an
   argument the way Mob_SpawnerRun already did. The generation-time call was
   measuring from the player's position, which is still the PREVIOUS world's
   at that moment (LocalPlayers_MoveToSpawn runs after the post-load hook
   returns), so the 32-block bubble was cleared around a meaningless point.
