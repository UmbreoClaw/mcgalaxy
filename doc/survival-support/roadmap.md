# Survival-support roadmap

How the MCGalaxy server side of the ClassiCube survival-test protocol is meant
to grow. Phases follow `doc/networking-plan.md` in the ClassiCube fork. This is
a living plan: the wire contract may still change, so treat message ids and
field lists as the current intent, not a frozen spec.

**Legend:** ✅ done · 🔜 next · ⬜ planned · 🔁 cross-cutting

Guiding rule (server-authoritative model): the server owns health, damage,
inventory, containers, mob AI, physics, and every RNG-/tick-driven event. The
client sends *intents* and renders; it never computes RNG-driven, multi-block,
or multi-entity changes. The server wins all reconciliation.

---

## ✅ Phase 0 — Handshake & capability (this branch)

Foundation, landed. See `session-notes.md`.

- `SurvivalTest` CPE extension advertised + negotiated → per-session `hasSurvival`.
- Per-map `SurvivalMode` gate in level config.
- `SURV_HELLO` (0x01) + `SURV_WORLDINFO` (0x02) sent on map join to capable
  clients on survival maps.
- Inbound `0xB0` traffic received, bounds-checked, capability-gated, logged.
- Stock Classic / CPE clients fully unaffected.

---

## 🔁 Cross-cutting work (do alongside the phases)

- ⬜ **Per-map `survivalActive` mode-flip (client) / authority split (server).**
  Before *changing* any simulated state, the client needs a per-map
  `survivalActive` flag (set on `SURV_HELLO`, cleared on new map) so stale
  survival state cannot leak across a `/goto` into a plain Classic level. On the
  server, gate the single-player simulation **off** in MP for every
  authoritative subsystem (mob AI/spawners, health/damage, furnace tick,
  day/night, random block ticks, explosions, inventory consumption) while
  keeping rendering/sound/GUI running. This is the prerequisite for Phases 2–5
  doing anything visible.
- ⬜ **Chunking for large messages.** A full inventory, a 54-slot container, or a
  burst of mob spawns will not fit in 63 payload bytes. Decide *once*: either a
  base-slot + run-of-N message sent repeatedly, or an explicit
  `[seq][total][chunk]` split. Document max element counts per message so
  neither side ever over-reads the fixed 64-byte buffer.
- 🔁 **Validate every inbound intent.** Independent of `hasSurvival`: bounds-check
  the payload, verify action legality (reach, cooldown, slot validity, container
  access), and reject invalid requests by sending an authoritative correction.
- 🔁 **Version negotiation.** Treat the negotiated `SurvivalTest` CPE ext version
  as the authoritative protocol version; branch wire-format changes on it and
  bump both sides together. `HELLO.protoVer` is reserved for finer-grained
  same-ext-version sub-revisions.
- 🔁 **Fallbacks for non-fork clients.** Keep driving day/night via stock CPE
  `EnvColors`, custom blocks via `BlockDefinitions`/fallback ids, etc., so stock
  Classic and CPE-only clients degrade gracefully (visitors on survival maps).
  ✅ *Landed so far: EnvColors day/night scaling and the ChangeModel mob mirror
  (`SurvivalFallbacks.cs`), custom-block fallback ids (`SurvivalBlocks.cs`).*
- 🔁 **Namespace hygiene.** `0xB0` is a shared PluginMessages namespace with no
  registry; keep the one-line "do not reuse" note in the server code.

---

## 🔶 Phase 1 — World generation & block metadata (block set + generator landed)

Server generates Indev/c0.30-s worlds and owns block metadata.

- ✅ **The Indev block set** (`SurvivalBlocks.cs`): level-scoped BlockDefinitions
  on Indev maps (1:1 port of the client's `IndevBlocks_Define` — ids 50–62 +
  view ids 71–97), applied/stripped live with the survival mode; classic
  fallback ids for pre-BlockDefs clients; the mine/place inventory bridge
  extended to the set (`PickupFor`/`PlaceCost`); `/Survival give` debug
  command; the `ToIndev`/`FromIndev`/`DataMeta` view-id ⇄ (id, meta) bijection
  ported as the authoritative encoding for the steps below. Live-tested.
- ✅ **Server-side Indev world generation** (`IndevGenerator.cs`): port of the
  client's oracle-verified `IndevGen.c` (LevelGenerator.java), registered as
  the `/NewLvl ... indev [theme] [type] [seed]` map theme - themes
  normal/hell/paradise/woods, types inland/island/floating/flat. Generated
  maps come out survival-ready (mode Indev, hazards, block set, theme env,
  spawn house with wall torches). `SURV_WORLDINFO` now carries genuine
  per-map ground/water levels + edge fluid via the level env config.
  Live-tested across all themes/types.
- ✅ Placement shaping (no 0x40 needed - the flattened view-id space carries
  the metadata): chests/furnaces rotate to face the placer, torches
  wall-mount off their support (unsupported = refused), chest
  triples/L-shapes refused, the non-Indev CPE leftovers (59/60/63/64/65)
  hidden + unplaceable on Indev maps; torch defs are proper thin columns
  for stock clients. Deviation: torch clicked-face mounting needs a face
  byte the classic place packet lacks (auto-pick wins; quality pass).
- ⬜ `SURV_BLOCKMETA (0x40)` — reserved for metadata the view-id space does
  NOT flatten (fire age, sapling growth stage) if it ever needs to stream.
- ✅ Block-ID space mapping at I/O boundaries + `.mclevel` (NBT) round trip:
  `McLevelImporter` expands genuine ids + the `Data` metadata nibble through
  the `SurvivalBlocks` bijection into view ids (imported maps come out
  survival-ready, theme recognised); the new `McLevelExporter`
  (`/Export <name> <level>` → `extra/import/`, `/Import`-able)
  writes the client's `MCLevel_Save` schema with a `LocalPlayer` stub,
  chest/furnace tile entities (live contents) and the level's LIVE MOBS as
  genuine entity compounds. The importer restores `TimeOfDay` into the per-map
  clock and turns `Entities`/`TileEntities` into a survival sidecar the
  persistence layer consumes exactly-once on first load - so mobs, chest and
  furnace contents round-trip. Live-verified (15 mobs + time through
  export -> import -> load).

## ✅ Phase 2 — Health & damage

Server owns health and the day/night clock. Core loop (health → damage → death →
respawn) is complete; graduated Indev damage is the one refinement left.

- ✅ `SURV_TIME (0x04)` — day/night driven by the server (scheduler clock, pushed
  to survival players + seeded at handshake). Now **per-map**: each level advances
  its own `Level.Config.SurvivalTime`, which saves with the `.lvl` so time of day
  persists across unload/reload.
- ✅ `SURV_HEALTH (0x03)` — authoritative health + score (stored in `Player.Extras`,
  sent at handshake and on change via `SetHealth`).
- ✅ `SURV_RESPAWN (0x87)` — client respawn intent → server resets health, repositions
  to spawn, echoes `SURV_HEALTH`.
- ✅ Damage/death bridge — `OnPlayerDied` maps every MCGalaxy hazard (fall/drown/
  lava/killer/weapons/`/kill`) into `SURV_HEALTH(0)` + respawn.
- ✅ Death-screen dwell — health held at 0 (auto-respawn suppressed, repeat
  hazard deaths cancelled) until the client's `SURV_RESPAWN` or a 30 s safety
  timeout; verified live against the real survival-test client (death camera +
  Game Over screen held, revive round-trip, stray-intent rejection).
- ✅ Hack permissions resolved from the survival config (`SurvivalCreative` ↔
  HELLO creative bit) instead of the MOTD on active survival maps.
- ✅ Genuine graduated player damage (`SurvivalHazards`): 20 TPS server tick
  for fall/drown/lava/fire/void, replacing the binary MCGalaxy bridge (which
  now only serves killer blocks + `/kill`). Live-tested.
- ⬜ *Refinements:* fire-block ignition (needs phase-1 custom blocks), a
  player on-fire overlay flag (reserved bit or `SURV_PLAYER_STATE`), armor
  absorption once armor exists.
- Damage sources: fall, drown, fire, lava, mob attacks, PvP (gated on
  `SurvivalPvP`). Death drops gated on `SurvivalDeathDrops`.

## ✅ Phase 3 — Mob streaming

Mobs stream into a dedicated puppet system (not standard CPE entities), to keep
Indev-specific animations (creeper swell, sheep grazing). Landed as
`SurvivalMobs.cs` + the client's `SurvivalTest_NetMob*` appliers, live-tested.

- ✅ `SURV_MOB_SPAWN 0x10`, `SURV_MOB_MOVE 0x11`, `SURV_MOB_STATE 0x12`,
  `SURV_MOB_DESPAWN 0x13` — see session-notes for the layouts + the sim scope.
- ✅ Server runs mob AI, spawner, physics, damage; client renders + interpolates.
- ✅ `SURV_ATTACK (0x80)` — reach-validated melee → damage/knockback/aggro/shear;
  now with **held-weapon damage** (`getDamageVsEntity`) and tool wear on the hit.
- ✅ Indev A* pathfinding (`Pathfinder`, weighted-wander fallback), skeleton
  arrows (phase-5 wire), block-destroying explosions (`SurvivalExplosions`,
  gated on `SurvivalBlockDamage`), sky/block-light model (`SurvivalGrowth`
  lighting), and **mob persistence** (`SurvivalPersistence` sidecar). All
  live-tested.
- ✅ **Mob-vs-mob arrow aggro + infighting** (Indev): EntityCreature.attackEntityFrom
  targets whatever entity hurt it last, so a skeleton arrow that tags another mob
  starts a mutual retaliation fight - the victim paths to and attacks the shooter
  with its own per-type behavior (melee/pounce/bow/fuse), targets displacing on
  each new hit. Live-verified (a four-way skeleton war).
- ✅ **PvP** (`SurvivalPvP` flag, HELLO bit2): melee via `SURV_ATTACK` targetKind 1
  (per-viewer entity id, resolved + reach-validated server-side, held-weapon
  damage through the victim's armor absorption) and player-fired arrows hitting
  players (previously ungated - now PvP-only; skeleton arrows always hit).
  Live-verified: gate off = no damage, gate on = damage.

## 🔶 Phase 4 — Inventory & containers (first slice landed)

Server owns inventory, containers, crafting, smelting.

- ✅ Inventory streaming: `SURV_INV_FULL 0x20` (chunked, ≤12 slots/frame — the
  chunking decision), `SURV_INV_SLOT 0x21`, `SURV_CURSOR 0x25`,
  `SURV_HELD_SLOT (0x85)`; clicks `SURV_SLOT_CLICK 0x82` /
  `SURV_RESULT_CLICK 0x83` / `SURV_CONT_CLOSE 0x84` handled server-side
  (GuiContainer model, echo-only). Mining→pickup / placing→consume block
  bridge. Live-tested. See session-notes for layouts + v1 deviations.
- ✅ Container GUIs over the wire: `SURV_USE_ITEM 0x81` (v1: opens) →
  `SURV_CONT_OPEN 0x22` / `SURV_CONT_SLOT 0x23` / `SURV_FURN_PROG 0x24`;
  server tile entities (chest/large chest/furnace), container clicks via the
  45..98 slot range, force-close on destruction. Live-tested.
- ✅ **Items** (`SurvivalItems.cs`): the full Indev item table (ids 256+,
  per-id max stacks: blocks 99 / items 64 / tools+food+armor 1), the genuine
  mining drop table (stone→cobble, coal ore→coal ITEM, gravel flint roll,
  crop seed rolls, pickaxe-tier harvest gating), the complete CraftingManager
  recipe set (fixed + generated tools/armor, mirrored matching) behind a real
  `RESULT_CLICK`, and TileEntityFurnace smelting on the 20 TPS tick (fuel
  burn, lit-block flip, FURN_PROG + CONT_SLOT streaming). All identical to
  the client's tables (the client renders the craft preview locally).
  Live-tested. `/Survival give` accepts item names/ids.
- 🔶 Right-click item USE_ITEM (`IndevTest_UseHeldItem` / `TryEat`): the client
  now sends `SURV_USE_ITEM` for a held hoe/seeds (targeted) or food (targetless
  sentinel), and the server applies it — hoe → farmland (+1 durability, grass's
  1/8 seed to inventory pending drops), seeds → crop + consume, food → heal +
  consume (soup → bowl), tool durability (`damageItem`, shatters past
  `32 << tier`). Live-tested server-side (farmland 60 / crop 59 / seed consumed
  / bread eaten / hoe dmg 1).
- ✅ **Flint & steel → fire** (`UseFlintSteel`, `IndevFire_UseFlintSteel`): a
  right-click steps one cell out of the clicked face and, if that interior cell
  is air, sets fire there (view 51) — which the fire physics then spreads and
  uses to catch adjacent TNT; the item wears 1 whether or not fire was placed.
  Client sends the intent (`heldId==256+3` added to the MP `USE_ITEM` gate).
  Live-tested (fire placed at the face cell, durability 0→1→2→3, fire → primed TNT).
- ✅ **Mining-tool durability** (`ItemStack.damageItem`): the held tool wears on
  every block broken (pick/shovel/axe 1, sword 2, others none) and the reverse
  on a melee hit, shattering past `32 << tier` — Indev-only, mirrors the client's
  `IndevTest_ToolUseWear`. Build-verified.
- ✅ **`SURV_PLAYER_EQUIP 0x50`** (a remote player's held item + 4 worn armor ids,
  broadcast on change) and **armor damage absorption** (`EntityPlayer.attackEntityFrom`:
  pieces wear by raw damage, absorb in 25ths, shatter). Live-tested.

## ✅ Phase 5 — Drops & advanced simulation

- ✅ Item drops (`SurvivalDrops`): `SURV_DROP_SPAWN 0x30`, `SURV_DROP_PICKUP 0x31`,
  `SURV_DROP_REMOVE 0x32`, intent `SURV_DROP_ITEM (0x86)`. Server-owned pop arc,
  pickup gating, 5-min despawn; mob-death / chest-scatter / player-death / blast
  scatter all feed it. Live-tested.
- ✅ Arrows (`SurvivalArrows`): `SURV_ARROW_SPAWN 0x33` / `STICK 0x34` /
  `REMOVE 0x35` / `AMMO 0x36`, intent `SURV_FIRE_ARROW 0x88`; c0.30 flight
  simulated client-side from the streamed seed, server owns sticks + hits.
- ✅ RNG-/tick-driven world simulation, all server-run (`SurvivalGrowth` +
  `SurvivalPhysics`) and pushed as block changes: grass spread, leaf decay,
  farmland moisture, crop + sapling growth, fire spread/burnout, and genuine
  **finite fluids** (springs, volume-conserving flow, stagnation/petrify).
  The client's own SP loops are gated off in MP. Live-tested.
- ✅ **Primed TNT** (`SurvivalTnt`): `SURV_TNT_SPAWN 0x37` / `SURV_TNT_REMOVE 0x38`.
  Igniting a TNT block — mining it, fire consuming it, or a blast catching it —
  removes the block and spawns a server-owned `PrimedTnt` entity that pops, falls,
  counts down its fuse, and detonates (`SurvivalMobs.ExplodeAt`); a blast that
  clears other TNT chain-ignites it with a short randomized fuse. The client
  simulates the hop/smoke/flash from the streamed seed and never explodes locally.
  Live-tested (fire → full-fuse detonation → chain reaction with partial fuses).
  **Melee defuse (c0.30 only)**: a swing at a primed TNT sends `SURV_ATTACK`
  targetKind 2; the server (`SurvivalTnt.Defuse`, gated on `SurvivalMode.Classic`)
  reach-validates, removes it with `TNT_REMOVE` reason 1 (no blast) and drops one
  TNT block back — genuine `PrimedTnt.hurt`. Live-tested on a c0.30 map.
- ✅ **Paintings** (`SurvivalPaintings`): `SURV_PAINT_SPAWN 0x39` /
  `SURV_PAINT_REMOVE 0x3A`, hung/removed through `SURV_ATTACK` targetKind 3,
  with the genuine once-per-100-ticks wall check dropping any whose support
  went away. Persist in the sidecar. Genuine treats these as entities, not
  blocks, so stock Classic clients cannot see them at all — a documented
  gap rather than a fallback.
- ✅ **Generation-time mob population** (`SurvivalMobs.PrePopulate`):
  LevelGenerator's "Spawning.." phase, seeding a new Indev world to the
  genuine per-kind caps and writing it to the sidecar before the level is
  ever loaded, matching what the client's generator has always done in
  singleplayer. `TrimExcessMobs` walks the surplus back down to the
  per-player budget once players arrive.
- ✅ **Map persistence** (`SurvivalPersistence` sidecar `extra/survival/<lvl>.sur`):
  mobs + chest/furnace contents saved on unload/save, restored on load; time of
  day + grown terrain persist on their own (level config + `.lvl`). Player
  inventories are session-only (deferred for a later pass).

## ⬜ Backlog (post-phase-5 polish)

Landed:

- ✅ Player-inventory persistence (`extra/survival/players/<name>.inv`): main +
  hotbar + worn armor saved on disconnect (shutdown kicks everyone, covering
  restarts), lazily restored on the session's first inventory touch. The craft
  grid + cursor stay session-only. Live-verified across a reconnect.
- ✅ Flint & steel → fire (server `USE_ITEM`) — see Phase 5.
- ✅ MP primed-TNT melee defuse (c0.30) — see Phase 5.
- ✅ Numbered release builds + a working `/update` tripwire (`Updater.cs`).
- ✅ `/Referee` made useful in survival; `/Track` added.

### 🔜 Next up

Nothing is blocking; these are ordered by how much they are worth, not by
dependency.

1. **Known small bugs.**
   - The client's `SurvivalTest_TrySpawnMobs` returns early on
     `area <= 0`, a gate that belongs to the c0.30 roll below it. Indev caps
     per-kind and does not use `area`, so any singleplayer map under 64³ never
     spawns mobs at all — the server has no such gate, so it is also an SP/MP
     split. One-line fix (move the Indev branch above the gate).
   - Torch clicked-face mounting still auto-picks its wall, because the
     classic place packet carries no face byte (Phase 1 note).
2. **Fidelity re-checks against the real sources.** The c0.30 jar and the
   deobfuscated in-20100223 tree are both usable now, and every pass over them
   so far has found something (the animal path-weight gate, `Level.isLit`
   being pure sky exposure, the skeleton burst's spawn height, torch
   `lightValue` being 13 rather than 14). Explosions, fluids and the growth
   tick have not had that treatment yet.
3. **Replay / world history.** The survival protocol is already a replay
   format — every entity frame is a self-contained 64-byte delta through one
   choke point (`SurvivalNet.SendMessage`), and there is no distance culling,
   so a recording covers the whole map rather than one viewer's bubble.
   Cheapest useful version is a bounded in-memory ring buffer per level dumped
   on demand, not a full archive. Free camera comes for free; per-player HUD
   state (health/inventory/containers) needs those single-recipient frames
   tagged with their recipient.
4. **Bridging survival and creative** so the server is survival-first without
   being hostile to creative players. Idea-stage only.
5. **The NAS (Not-Awesome-Script) bridge.** Sketched and verified to compile
   against this fork; notes are parked outside the repo. Not started.
6. **macOS GUI.** `MCGalaxyGUI` fails on the Carbon driver; the CLI is fine.
   A console fallback is the cheap fix. Explicitly deferred.

Deferred by design (each is a protocol or scope change, not polish):

- Partial drop pickup (a stack that only partly fits).
- Widening entity coordinates from i16 to i32 — a wire break needing a
  coordinated CPE ext version bump on both sides.
- `SURV_BLOCKMETA 0x40`, only if metadata ever appears that the view-id space
  cannot flatten.

## How to add a message (the pattern)

1. It already has a reserved id in `enum`-style constants in `SurvivalNet.cs`.
2. **Server → client:** add a `SendXxx(...)` builder next to `SendHello` /
   `SendWorldInfo`; write `[id][fields...]` into a 64-byte payload (respect the
   chunking rule for anything that can exceed 63 bytes) and call
   `SendMessage(p, payload)`. Send it from the appropriate authoritative
   subsystem, gated on `SurvivalNet.Active(p, lvl)`.
3. **Client → server:** add a `case` in `HandlePluginMessage`; bounds-check,
   validate the action, apply it authoritatively, and echo the corrected state.
4. Keep the byte layout in lockstep with the client's `src/SurvivalNet.h`; if it
   changes, bump the `SurvivalTest` CPE ext version on both sides.
5. Update `session-notes.md` (wire format table) and this roadmap.
